          "text": "The stream of false and manipulative claims about Covid-19 hasn’t decreased for weeks. Various participants are spreading false information on platforms such as Youtube and Facebook. A data analysis conducted by CORRECTIV.Faktencheck shows that Youtube is the platform most frequently reported by users for spreading questionable information. Around 46 percent of the links sent to us requesting a fact check lead to the video platform.\n\nAt the same time, Whatsapp is the most important distribution channel: 34 percent of users declared that Whatsapp is where they had seen the potentially false information for the first time. You could say that Whatsapp is the motorway for fake news related to the coronavirus, with Youtube videos being the racing cars.\n\nThe result: the dissemination of false information can be huge within the shortest of timeframes. According to a recent survey conducted by Forsa and commissioned by the regional media office of North Rhine-Westphalia, 81 percent of people in Germany believe that they have already come across disinformation about the coronavirus on the internet.\n\nThe source of the evaluated data is CORRECTIV’s CrowdNewsroom, and they are not representative. Readers have been able to submit content that they consider to require a fact- check to the site that to require since mid-March. We have evaluated more than 1,800 reports over all. They are based on users’ subjective assessments which pieces of information could be false. Thus, not all of them are necessarily fake.\n\nHowever, what the submissions clearly show is which posts about the coronavirus have made people uncertain or aroused their mistrust, and the way in which this information reaches them.\n\nThe platform: around 46 percent of the links lead to Youtube\n\nYoutube’s particular importance becomes clear when you take a look at the platforms that appear most frequently in our data: An analysis of more than 1,400 links submitted to the CrowdNewsroom shows that 45.8 percent lead to videos on Youtube.\n\nSecond place goes to websites with 30.6 percent, followed by Facebook with 16.6 percent. As there is no way to create links to Whatsapp, the instant messenger cannot be included in this evaluation.\n\nThis means that by far the most frequent source of potentially false information reported to us by readers are Youtube videos.\n\nThe dissemination method: 34 percent state that they received the information via Whatsapp\n\nWhen asked where they came across the information for the first time, 34 percent of users answered that it was Whatsapp. Facebook follows in second place with 28.8 percent. 14.2 percent of users indicated Youtube as their first contact, while 7.6 percent said it was websites.\n\nWhatsapp is the way most people first come into contact with potentially false information – for example, because it was sent to them by family or friends.\n\nThus, Whatsapp is the most common dissemination channel for questionable information – and Youtube is the place where it can be found.\n\nThe result of our data analysis reflects the great importance of these two platforms on the German market. According to an ARD-ZDF online survey (2019), 40 percent of the population as a whole access Youtube at least once a week. The video platform is particularly popular with younger internet users: 82 percent of people aged 14 to 29 visit it at least once a week.\n\nBut Whatsapp is even more widespread in Germany: In 2019, 75 percent used the instant messenger at least once a week. In the case of people aged between 14 and 49, this figure even increases to more than 90 percent. Facebook is used by 31 percent of all people at least once a week.\n\nFalse information on health subjects is dangerous\n\nThe fact that false information on health issues is being disseminated over social networks is not new – but the corona crisis has aggravated the problem.\n\nFalse reports about Covid-19 spread internationally. For example, Whatsapp messages claiming that you should always take your shoes off at your front door because the coronavirus adheres to them, were sent in Germany, Ireland, and Croatia. And the false claim that drinking a sip of water every 15 minutes prevents infection, circulated on Whatsapp in Germany and Spain and on Facebook in Lithuania, Croatia, and the Philippines.\n\nNumerous doctors, including virologist Christian Drosten, recently asked large technology companies in an open letter to act against the “infodemic”. The operators of the platforms should “take immediate systemic action to stem the flow of health misinformation, and the public health crisis it has triggered”. The doctors also refer to cheap propaganda targeting the vaccinations against measles as an example of this.\n\n“Once a piece of fake news gets into someone’s mind, it is anchored there in a relatively stable manner”\n\nSabrina Heike Kessler, of the Department of Communication and Media Research at the University of Zurich is a communication scientist specializing in science communication. She says: “The fact that people believe in fake news concerning health issues can also be explained by the human desire to be healthy, stay healthy, or to get well, and the fear of illness and death.” When it comes to health, human beings are evolutionarily designed to rely on the thinking, recommending, and actions of others.\n\nThis is partly the reason of why false information about Covid-19 is spreading so swiftly, Kessler explains to CORRECTIV. “If the information that you read about the coronavirus is also plausible and fits into your own world view, it is stored directly in your mind. Once a piece of fake news gets into someone’s mind, it is anchored there in a relatively stable manner and it is exceedingly difficult to remove.”\n\nWhat are technology companies doing about this?\n\nYoutube, Whatsapp, and Facebook don’t remain idle when faced with these issues. They are already taking measures to limit the spread of false reports.\n\nThus, Whatsapp has, since early April, restricted the forwarding of messages, which can now only be re-sent to a maximum of five chats. In addition, messages that have previously been forwarded five times can only be sent to one further chat. Upon request, Whatsapp informed us that this has reduced the amount of heavily forwarded messages by 70 percent.\n\nWhatsapp also emphasizes that they support the work of fact checkers worldwide, as well as working with public authorities. In fact, users have recently been able to communicate with the WHO or the German Federal Ministry of Health on the subject of Covid-19 via a Whatsapp chatbot.\n\nThe Facebook company, which owns Whatsapp, has been cooperating with independent fact checkers like CORRECTIV for several years. As a result, people who have shared incorrect information on the social network are, also retrospectively, informed about this fact. In addition, Facebook states that posts about the coronavirus “that could pose an imminent threat to physical harm” are deleted on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nYoutube: “We are working at full blast”\n\nYoutube has no fact-checking program yet. The company removes videos with false medical information about Covid-19. Youtube spokesman Georg Nolte informed us by email that an example for this would be videos that claim that the coronavirus doesn’t exist. Or that recommend “medically unsubstantiated methods” to avoid infection and prevent people from getting treatment. He also states that videos “explicitly denying the effectiveness of the guidelines of the WHO or the respective health authority, which could lead to people violating these guidelines” are deleted.\n\n“We are working at full blast to protect our users from misinformation and want to connect them to reliable and helpful messages,” says Nolte. In consultation with the German Federal Ministry of Health, info boxes were installed under the relevant videos, on the homepage, and in the search feature on Youtube. “We want to draw the attention of as many people as possible to the information panels of the Ministry and the related institutes. From a global perspective, we have already generated 14 billion impressions on the information pages of the various health organizations.”\n\nIn Germany, Youtube has, for some time now, actually displayed a link to the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) in videos on Covid-19.\n\nBut is this enough? Some videos are not deleted because it isn’t evident that they meet the criteria mentioned. They usually have a lot of opinion content – and they are often misleading. An example of this is a 30-minute post by blogger Ken Jebsen, in which he makes several false claims and speculates that Bill Gates has taken control of healthcare in order to push through a forced administration of vaccines. Numerous readers have referred us to this KenFM Youtube video, with, by now, more than three million views.\n\nA video interview with Stefan Homburg, in which he claims that the government’s lockdown was unnecessary and ineffective, is also still online, although in the introduction moderator Milena Preradovic urges all viewers to please adhere to regulations regarding the coronavirus. On the other hand, it is, for example, no longer possible to find a video that places the statements of an Italian doctor on the coronavirus into the wrong context.\n\nChain letters on Whatsapp or videos on Youtube often reach extremely wide coverage before the first fact checks or media reports on them are published. And Youtube’s reference to the Federal Centre for Health Education, which is also displayed below Ken Jebsen‘s video, can be misleading under certain circumstances. Users who don’t know the background might actually consider it an indication of the seriousness of the claims therein.\n\nThe reference to the Federal Centre for Health Education appears below a video in which Ken Jebsen claims that Bill Gates took control of the health system to push through a forced administration of vaccines. (Screenshot: CORRECTIV)\n\nAccording to an assessment by communication scientist Kessler, Youtube tries to counter false reports and agitation, but: “Youtube will only be able to chase the fake news disseminators unless fundamentally new measures are taken.”\n\nAnother problem is that big companies release few data for scientific studies. “Both Youtube and Whatsapp are difficult to study for the field of social science research,” says Kessler. Nobody knows exactly what the extent of the false reports about the coronavirus look like on there.\n\nIn her view, companies need to do more. They should “invest more money, hire more people to track down fake news, cooperate more with independent fact checkers and work more with independent social science researchers to effectively and adequately combat the spread of fake news.”\n\nSpecial Evaluation: Below we list the five Youtube channels that were most frequently reported to CORRECTIV Schwindelambulanz Sinsheim / Dr. Bodo Schiffmann Videos by Bodo Schiffmann, a doctor who operates a clinic for diseases like vertigo in Sinsheim, were submitted to us 131 times. He opposes the government’s coronavirus measures and recently even founded a party: „Widerstand2020” (“Resistance 2020”). As if by assembly line, Schiffmann has been producing videos on the coronavirus for weeks. His videos are full of speculation – something reflected by the frequency with which readers submitted them to the CrowdNewsroom. eingeSCHENKt.tv Videos from the Youtube channel “eingeSCHENKt.tv” were reported 73 times. Journalist Thomas Schenk is behind this channel, with 85,000 subscribers, and posts that are more political than scientific in nature. Previous to the coronavirus crisis, videos with titles such as “CO2 und Klima(lüge)?” (“CO2 and climate [lie]?”) were published there, as well as interviews with Max Otte from the Values Union of the CDU, or the right-wing Youtuber Heiko Schrang. Currently, the channel frequently reports on the so-called hygiene demos. Prof. Dr. med. Sucharit Bhakdi Sucharit Bhakdi is Professor Emeritus of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene at the University of Mainz. Links to his videos were sent to us by users 43 times. His Youtube channel was created just a few weeks ago and has around 71,000 subscribers – but some of his videos record one to two million views. KenFM “KenFM” is the Youtube channel of blogger Ken Jebsen and counts 466,000 subscribers. In his videos, he generally downplays the dangerousness of the coronavirus and expresses suspicion about a big conspiracy behind the pandemic, including, among others, Bill Gates as puppet master. KenFM’s posts were sent to the CrowdNewsroom 34 times. PUNKT.Preradovic Videos from “PUNKT.Preradovic”, the Youtube channel of the former RTL presenter Milena Preradovic, with 37,000 subscribers, were reported 33 times. Among others, she interviewed Sucharit Bhakdi, who claimed that vaccinations against the coronavirus are “senseless”; economist Stefan Homburg, who considered the lockdown as unnecessary and superfluous; and physician Wolfgang Wodarg, who questioned the dangerousness of the coronavirus.\n\nText: Alice Echtermann\n\nData Analysis: Michel Penke, Max Donheiser\n\nGraphics: Benjamin Schubert\n\nCooperation with the CrowdNewsroom: Till Eckert, Bianca Hoffmann, Matthias Bau, Steffen Kutzner"

          "text": "von Olaya Argüeso , Justus von Daniels\n\nIt has taken the European Banking Authority (EBA) a year and a half to realise what CORRECTIV and its partners exposed through the CumEx Files investigation: There is no cooperation between national authorities in the EU, which gave criminals leeway to carry out illegal dividend arbitrage trades across the Union for decades.\n\nThe EBA published a report Tuesday in response to a request by the EU Parliament after the publication of the CumEx Files. Sven Giegold, financial and economic policy spokesperson of the Greens/EFA group, described the report as “embarrassing”. Giegold said that the banking supervisor “does not respond in the slightest to Parliament’s questions”. Shortly after the CumEx Files came to light in October 2018, the EU Parliament demanded a detailed investigation and a plan to prevent such schemes in the future.\n\nThrough the so called cum-ex trades, bankers, lawyers and traders executed dividend arbitrage deals in different tax jurisdictions with the aim of filing multiple tax claims of the same withholding tax. The business model was based on plundering the public treasury. According to CORRECTIV’s investigation, they could have robbed over €55bn since the beginning of the 2000s. The first trial has just finished in Bonn (Germany), where two traders have been granted suspended sentences.\n\nSince May 2019, the EBA has carried out two surveys among the national banking supervisors on the risk the cum-ex trades could pose in terms of money laundering and financing of terrorism, and in connection with the governance of financial institutions.\n\nThe findings are devastating: each country has a different understanding of which activities are considered tax crime, which means not every country considers cum-ex trades as a criminal activity, and even in those member states where some kind of criminal investigation was going on, the supervisors did not take action because “they were waiting for the outcome of criminal investigations before considering the impact on their sector”, according to the report. What is more, most of the surveyed supervising bodies did not cooperate with other public authorities in their jurisdiction (such as tax authorities) or in other member states because they thought their country had not been a target of these schemes.\n\nCORRECTIV’s investigation exposed the key role that financial institutions played in facilitating the cum-ex trades. However, according to the EBA’s surveys, most national supervising authorities (namely, each country’s central bank) did not take any action against the banks involved in the dividend arbitrage schemes.\n\nAs a result of its analysis, the EBA admits that cooperation and information exchange between public authorities “appear to have been attempted in a minority of cases and only where risks had crystallised”. The institution also recognises that the complexity of EU laws is another hurdle for cooperation: “This may make the exchange of information between competent authorities and tax authorities difficult”, writes the EBA.\n\nAfter gathering the responses to its survey among national supervisors, the EBA laid out a 10 point action plan to boost the “future” regulation applicable to such schemes, which consists on amending a series of guidelines on the internal governance of banks, the suitability of their managers and anti money laundering supervision. Most of these updates will not be published until the first half of 2021. The EBA also plans a further inquiry “into the actions taken by financial institutions and national authorities within their competencies to supervise compliance with requirements applicable to” cum-ex trades. They have not yet set a date.\n\nIn Giegold’s opinion, “the patchwork of national supervisors together with a weak European Banking Authority is dysfunctional”, and called for a complete overhaul of EBA’s decision-making structures.\n\nIn response to CORRECTIV’s questions, the EBA wrote that its report “identified a number of issues with regard to the role of national authorities in fighting dividend arbitrage trading schemes”. However, it also admits that “some of these issues are beyond the remit and powers of national supervisory authorities or the EBA”."

          "title": "A Kick On Pills – Painkillers in Football",
          "text": "I’m ready. It’s a warm, midsummer day in the Austrian winter sports resort of Seefeld. The aroma of fir trees saturates the air. The tires of my mountain bike are full, and I have already had a first test ride. Stretched out before me is a white, pebble trail that leads from the small mountain village of Mösern through a fir forest in the Austrian Alps, and pastures that extend to the sports fields. At this precise moment, the football players of the Bundesliga club RB Leipzig are training there, finishing warm-up exercises with a view of the ski jump. They will have to pass me on their way out.\n\nMany international clubs travel to Austria to prepare for the summer season. In the shadow of the Alps, the Champions League semi-finalist Ajax Amsterdam, as well as several clubs from England and Russia, are getting ready for the 2019 tournaments. They use the time to brace themselves for the stress of the coming months. Now, the players from Leipzig are doing circuit training in front of me.\n\nIt’s been three months since nine colleagues and I started our investigation into painkiller abuse in football. As a journalist, you sometimes have to follow unusual paths. At this point in time, we‘ve made 73 phone calls and written countless emails. We’ve contacted physicians, officials, and football professionals from the German Bundesliga with requests to tell us about their experiences. Some of them asked to have their name redacted. Others spoke out openly.\n\nThey talked about Voltaren, opioids, and infusions. Some mention performance-enhancing substances and painkillers distributed in locker rooms as if they were candy, and report dubious practices in clubs abroad. Others do not want to say anything. It is particularly difficult to approach active players. They are shielded by their clubs.\n\nThe training field in the Austrian Alps where RB Leipzig players prepare for the 2019 season. © Jonathan Sachse\n\nI look further down the slope, trying to see if anybody is already there. On one side of the mountain is the training ground, reserved for two weeks by their club. On the other side, the luxury hotel where the players spend the training season. Unlike racing cyclists who train up to eight hours per day, football players – even professionals – get a large chuck of free time in between practices. They idle away the hours playing PlayStation or poker. The players from Leipzig come to the sports field twice a day, for an hour and a half each time. After that, as I observed the day before, most players will ride their bicycles on the gravel road for 3 kilometers back to the hotel. Once there, no one from the club’s press department will be present.\n\nThis could be my chance. My plan is to catch up with them by bike, say hello, and start a friendly conversation. “Oh, so you’re professional football players?” Then, I’ll skillfully approach the subject of interest. As a journalist, I’m looking for players who will talk about their everyday life – injuries, pressure, recovery – about testing limits, and about painkillers. Because that is exactly what our investigation is about.\n\nThe largest five European football leagues – located in England, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France — generated more than 15 billion euros in the 2017/18 season. The European Championship, a competition across 12 countries — now cancelled due to COVID-19 — was posed to earn another billion euros in revenue. Needless to say, the football industry is thriving. It is a product that pays as long as the competition is fit. With millions to be earned in salaries and bonuses, there is also incentive for players to stay in the game.\n\nBy 35, most players are at the end of their career. But until then, many want to earn as much as possible. The pressure to perform is high. If your body starts gives out, it must be helped – with painkillers and possibly other substances. Because, in this business, hardly anyone can afford injuries or pain.\n\nThe first players are approaching. Three, then seven, then eleven on bikes. The training is over. Midfielder Kevin Kampl is part of the group, recognizable by his bleached hair. I also recognize Timo Werner and Marcel Sabitzer. I turn onto the gravel path and let two of the players from Leipzig pass me. Three more follow. They are riding pretty fast. Is the return trip part of the training? I accelerate and try to at least keep up with the next group, fighting my way up the slope – but I still can’t get close. The headwind caused by two midfielders carries away my timid “hello”, and the hope of getting insider information with it. After two minutes even the last one in front of me has disappeared into the fir forest. Bundesliga professionals. On e-bikes. Faster than a curious journalist.\n\nIn 2002, the world football association, FIFA, started to research the abuse of painkillers in football. FIFA experts were soon able to prove that painkillers are part of everyday life at the World Cup. In 2018, one in four players in Russia took painkillers before each match — one particular player even used three different painkillers. The findings of the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups in 2005 and 2007 were also shocking: almost half of the players took painkillers while competing at the tournament.\n\nFIFA’s internal research into painkillers was developed by physician Jiri Dvorak. Under his leadership, and after several tournaments, the sheets showing the medications taken by all national players during the 72 hours before kick-off were evaluated. “The result was devastating,” says Dvorak. “When we evaluated the numbers, we saw that the consumption of medications is enormous.”\n\nIn an interview with CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team, Dvorak remembers a sheet in which all 23 players confessed to having taken Voltaren, and some of them even to having taken an additional painkiller. Another table showed five different medications given to a young player for a single match. “Taking painkillers for prophylactic purposes is misuse,” says Dvorak. “It absolutely cannot be justified scientifically and is counterproductive”.\n\nThe 71-year-old Swiss citizen with Czech roots stopped working for FIFA in 2016. The new president, Gianni Infantino, closed the entire medical research department previously headed by Dvorak. Today, the physician demands that “[p]ainkillers should be banned if they are not medically necessary”.\n\nFIFA’s figures show that painkiller abuse is not just a problem in German football. Most football players stay silent about their experience with Voltaren and other medications. Their stories only appear occasionally in press reports.\n\nOne of them is Daniel Agger, who played 232 matches for Liverpool in the Premier League. “I have taken too much anti-inflammatories in my career, my body could not cope with it,” he said in an interview with the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in 2016. Throughout his entire career, he had taken painkillers in excess of the recommended dose. The spring of 2015 was no exception: at this point he had switched to the Danish club Brondby and wanted to play at the local derby despite an injury. He took four tablets in the hours before the match. On the field, he no longer had control over his body and had to be substituted after half an hour. A short time later he had to end his career, at the age of 31. “Maybe my story will make other athletes take fewer pills,” said Agger.\n\nAfter the end of his career, former Liverpool defender Daniel Agger spoke openly about painkiller abuse. © Eddie Keogh / picture alliance / REUTERS\n\nStories like Agger’s prompted us to address the painkiller abuse with journalists from other major football-playing nations and to speak with more professionals. From. There, CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team began collaborating with French journalists from France 2 and with colleagues from Italian La Stampa and Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI).\n\nEven though the considerable amount of painkiller consumption has been acknowledged for the past 18 years, the general reaction to their abuse seems absurd from a medical standpoint: more and more matches and competitions are being held, posing additional challenges for the players, only intensifying the pressure and scope of abuse.\n\nUnlike doping agents, medications for pain and inflammation in competitive sports are generally legal — something that several insiders think is wrong. “You can simply perform better with painkillers,” says Hans Geyer, a doping researcher from Cologne. The scientist demands that painkillers be classified as doping agents. “Painkillers,” says Geyer, “are extremely harmful to health.” According to the definition by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), a substance must be included in the list of prohibited drugs if it fulfills two of a total of three doping criteria. Painkillers conform to two criteria on account of the increase in performance and the damage to health. This is how Geyer sees it.\n\nWe started our investigation looking into the abuse of prescription drugs in football. For this purpose, CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team joined forces. It soon became clear: beyond prescription drugs, the abuse of painkillers is also a problem – and possibly a more pressing one.\n\nIn response to a survey, 1142 amateur footballers shared their experiences with painkillers and doping. We also interviewed over 100 professional football players, most of them from the Bundesliga. Some finished their careers in the 1990s and early 2000s, others of them only recently. Three of them are currently playing. All of these professionals shared their experiences with us. One of them is Jonas Hummels, the younger brother of the national player Mats Hummels.\n\nIn December 2015, nine days before Christmas, Jonas Hummels was suffering from severe pain. His knee had been plaguing him for months. Before training, he took the painkiller Arcoxia. After sprinting away, he suddenly came to a stop, screaming. His kneecap was pressing on a nerve. At this point, jumping and landing after a header would simply no longer be possible.\n\n“You could tell me nine times that I was taking too many painkillers. And nine times I would not have listened to you,” Hummels says today. At the time, though, he remembers ignoring the consequences of the substance abuse.\n\nJonas Hummels speaks out about the dark side of professional football and the consumption of painkillers. © Ralph Ziegenhorn for EyeOpening.Media\n\nOne week later, Hummels faced the Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen alongside his team, the Spielvereinigung Unterhaching. They were one of the final 16 teams left in the DFB Cup. It could be the highlight of his career. Hummels was the captain of the third-division club and normally, he would lead his team onto the field. But he already had to give up that plan. At the very least, he wanted to be part of the team on the field, to get out there somehow, maybe even substituted in.\n\nBefore the match, Hummels tried taking the usual painkillers but realized they don’t work. The pain is too strong. His body had built up a tolerance. But he desperately wanted to be on the field and the team’s physician wanted to help him, too, before a match that would be so important to the captain. The orthopedist suggested a local anesthesia to Hummels. It was his only chance.\n\nHummels agrees. One hour before the match, the physician injects Hummels’ knee four times and presses the serum into his veins. Three hours later, his team loses the cup match against the first division’s Leverkusen 1-3. Hummels did not play for a single minute, but he was there. He later described the evening as a “supreme highlight”.\n\nThat night was the end for Jonas Hummels. With cruciate ligament ruptures and cartilage damage in both knees, Hummels could hardly climb stairs without feeling pain at the age of 25.\n\nLike Hummels, many players rely on the short-term effects of painkillers. Sometimes they know absolutely nothing about possible long-term consequences. But they can be severe: Muscle injuries, damage to kidneys, liver, and joints. Arthrosis at a young age, and a higher risk of heart problems.\n\nIn some cases, players develop questionable routines that may only become dangerous for them at a later time. The story of a player who wants to remain anonymous and played for years in the lower professional leagues in Italy is an example of this. “Every Saturday evening before the match, I would go to the hospital, where a friend of mine injected cortisone into my fingers or legs so I could play the next day,” says the former goalkeeper, who is now a coach. As a thank you for the treatment, he would give the doctor a bottle of wine. During his career he played in multiple leagues, and some of his teammates played for different A-series clubs.\n\nHe ended his career at the age of 41. “I could no longer jump to the right, but I made a good wage and needed the money,” he says about his health at the end of his sports career. For years, his family had been able to live on what he earned as a semi-professional football player. Today, he says, “I ruined my body.”\n\nIn addition to visits to the hospital, he also used painkillers on his own for more than 20 years, among them Aulin, which has the active ingredient nimesulide. “Before each game, I would take two Aulin tablets, without water.” By the end of his career, he was on the brink of kidney failure and had already undergone five operations.\n\nSuch testimonials show how painkiller abuse slowly turns into addiction. Despite our failed investigation with RB Leipzig at Seefeld, we still succeeded in having conversations in Austria with the managers of other Bundesliga teams that were also preparing for the 2019/20 season in the Alps. We held an off-the-record conversation with a Bundesliga physician there and received telephone numbers for further research. At the end of a trip that took us through six training camps, it is at least clear that we have to talk to more people in the professional football system if we want to learn more about substances and methods.\n\nUnlike Hummels, most former football professionals do not want share their history with painkiller abuse. They do not even want to be quoted anonymously. A “tough guy mentality” permeates the sport. Few people even dare to talk about weaknesses after finishing their career. Their stories show how, for decades, footballers have become ill due to the use of painkillers. Stiff feet, early arthrosis, life-threatening atrial fibrillation; they now have to live with these physical issues for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn spring, we meet Thomas Frölich, TSG Hoffenheim’s team physician. During his time in paid football, he has worked with numerous successful coaches, such as Joachim Löw, Felix Magath and Ralf Rangnick, and most recently, Julian Nagelsmann. He is often with the team, says Frölich, which means he can control access to medications. He only releases tablets “in limited quantities”.\n\nThomas Frölich, now the TSG Hoffenheim team doctor, says he talked frequently with players about their consumption of painkillers. © EyeOpening.Media\n\nHowever, even Hoffenheim’s team doctor eases access to medication as kick-off draws closer. “If someone comes to me 45 minutes before the match, I cannot argue with him for half an hour, so I am a little more generous,” said the team doctor. Frölich said that again and again, players who are new to the club ask him for painkillers, often out of routine. “Then you have to try to get them out of the habit,” says Frölich. “Because he often has no pain at all.”\n\nIn addition, football clubs cannot constantly control their players. Common pain relievers are actually available in low doses in any pharmacy without a prescription. For example, ibuprofen brands is sold over the counter, up to a dosage of 400 mg.\n\nAn anecdote from 1998 shows the consequences of taking painkillers without medical control. At the time, Frölich’s VfB Stuttgart was in the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup final match against Chelsea. The team doctor had prescribed Voltaren for a player, but he spat blood after the match. The reason: the player had also taken aspirin on his own volition. The combination of the active ingredients of both medications increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Frölich gave the player infusions and kept stayed by his bed. The player survived the night. At some point his stomach stopped bleeding.\n\nJonas Hummels also remembers medicine cabinets filled to the brim with painkillers. If you wanted ibuprofen, you usually got it. A former Bundesliga player, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that a few years ago a physiotherapist was standing at the entrance to the team’s bus and was holding a bag of painkillers: everyone could help themselves freely before leaving for the match.\n\nThe conscious use of medication to improve performance in professional football has already played a role in the past. A court case against Riccardo Agricola proves that. The Italian was a doctor in the dominant Juventus team in the 1990s, which included the players Alessandro del Piero, Didier Deschamps, and Zinedine Zidane. Agricola was accused of systematically influencing player performance by means of medications. “It turned out that the majority of the medication was not used in accordance with prescriptions and therefore not for the treatment of specific diseases,” says the first-instance judgment in 2004, to which CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team gained access. The Juve professionals did not receive painkillers for therapeutic purposes. “If there is no possibility of using painkillers, it would not be easy to play all the matches of the championship,” two former players of the team are quoted as saying in the case file.\n\nAt that time, prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello led the investigation, and the 79-year-old man still feels frustrated so many years later. “I didn’t have a single witness who wanted to speak,” he told us over the phone. The code of silence of professional football applies any time and anywhere.\n\nNeven Subotic is the only active professional player who agreed to speak publicly about painkillers for our investigation. We met him at CORRECTIV’s office in Berlin. Spring is approaching but it’s still cold outside.\n\nSubotic started his professional career at the age of 18 with the 1. FSV Mainz 05 under coach Jürgen Klopp. Later Klopp brought him to Dortmund. Twice, Subotic and his club were named German champions. Today, he plays for Union Berlin. In total, he has played more than 200 Bundesliga matches. He also stood on the field with the Serbian national team at the 2010 World Cup.\n\nNeven Subotic speaks at CORRECTIV’s Berlin office about the painkiller crisis in German football. © EyeOpening.Media\n\n“I believe the whole system is missing an official who can sure that everything is done properly,” says Subotic. At the moment, football regulations work through the transfer of pressure. It is about earning more money. The clubs needs to be successful, and so the coaches feels pressured. The coach passes on the pressure to their assistant coaches or to the physicians. “And in the end, it’s the player who gets the most pressure. He can’t play unless he takes painkillers.” The central defender also played in France for a year and a half, where the system is similar – as well as the problematic consumption of painkillers.\n\nHe hardly uses painkillers himself, says Subotic, and that he’d rather miss a match. At the same time, he observes how ibuprofen is distributed for “every little pain”. He advises younger players to act on their own and regularly seek an opinion from external doctors who do not have a conflict of interest with the club. “And in the end, it’s the player who suffers the most pressure and who has the most to lose,” Subotic says. If a player sustains permanent damage, he is quickly out on his own.\n\nNeven Subotic demands that players must also learn more about the medications that are often part of their day-to-day work. “What I have noticed in the past 14 years is that ibuprofen is distributed like candy. For every little pain they immediately give you ibuprofen,” says Subotic. He says he wishes that the effects of painkillers on former football players were investigated. “We need information about what happens after the career ends and the cases should also be made public anonymously – as a warning.”\n\nIn recent years, three studies have provided answers to the question of the harmful effects of painkillers. They confirm that the regular use of painkillers increases the likelihood of experiencing significant heart problems. In a 2011 study, Swiss researchers found that diclofenac (Voltaren) and etoricoxib (Arcoxia), both popular among footballers, increases the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Danish scientists also found that diclofenac significantly increases that risk. The same applies to ibuprofen. And two years ago, another Danish study confirmed that diclofenac increases the rate of developing a heart problem during the first 30 days after ingestion.\n\nIbuprofen 400 can be bought at any pharmacy without a prescription, making it one of the most popular painkillers among football players. © Collage von Ivo Mayr\n\n“There is a clear link between death caused by a heart attack and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,” explains Gunnar Gislason. He is one of the Danish researchers who works with heart related risks. “These medications affect the cardiovascular system. We know that they affect blood pressure, that they affect the kidneys.” As a result, painkillers can indeed kill. So is the story of one player from France.\n\nOn April 6, 2018, Samba Diop comes home from training. The 18-year-old plays for the second division club Le Havre AC. He was doing lighter training after having to stop for a few weeks because of mononucleosis. When he gets home, he tells his mother that he does not feel well. He gets worse, vomits several times, and collapses on the way to the toilet at 3:30 a.m. His mother calls an ambulance.\n\nThe young talent is supposed to sign his first professional contract in the coming days. Were it not for the hip pain that has plagued Diop for weeks, he would also be playing an important match the next day. He talks to the medical department about it and, after the daily training, is sent to see a physician who injects him with the painkiller ketoprofen, which is often used for osteoarthritis. “I’m going to die and it’s because of the injection,” Samba later tells his mother at home. Arame Diop recalls this dramatic moment at the end of last year in a conversation with the media outlet Loopsider. There, Samba’s mother describes the night and the course of events.\n\nSamba Diop is taken to the hospital in the middle of the night, where his condition worsens, and he dies in the morning. “I want the club to tell me the truth, that’s all,” said Arame Diop, more than a year later, to the media outlet Loopsider.\n\n“I want the club to break its silence”, says Arame Diop. Her son Samba Diop, player at Le Havre AC (France), died after receiving an injection from the team doctor. © Screenshot from Loopsider\n\nThe autopsy report, which CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team obtained access to, states multi-organ failure as a preliminary cause of death – a possible side effect of ketoprofen. However, for two years, no definitive answers have been given regarding the cause Samba Diop’s death . “The autopsy leaves the cause of death open. It is not possible to know the exact reasons. But it excludes some options such as a pre-existing heart condition,” says Yassine Bouzrou, who represents the Diop family in a lawsuit against the club. It is about who is to blame for Samba’s death. The family has sued the authorities of the club and the physician for manslaughter.\n\nFor two years, lawyer Bouzrou has been asking for complementary analyses and investigations. Since there has been no response by the French justice system, he threatens to bring the case before another court, Bouzrou told a collaborating France 2 reporter.\n\nThe Diop family still lives in uncertainty. Was the injection of painkillers the cause of Samba’s death? The silence of those responsible speaks volumes about an industry in which painkillers help players to perform – but often at their own risk.\n\nThe issue of painkiller abuse in football does not always have such drastic consequences. According to our survey of over 1,100 football players, which cannot be considered representative, over half of participants used painkillers several times throughout a season to play football. More than 40 percent took painkillers not for therapeutic reasons, but to increase their performance.\n\nVery few are concerned with the consequences for their health. At the same time, hundreds report negative consequences: stomach problems, as well as liver and kidney damage. Several also reported becoming addicted to opioids when over-the-counter painkillers no longer worked.\n\nHalf of survey participants said they did not know about the increased risk of heart disease caused by painkiller use. Rather, amateur footballers reported that their coaches had given them pills before the match. When it comes to painkiller abuse, amateurs and professionals play in the same league.\n\nThe German Football Association has always seen itself as protecting the interests of German amateur football players. Its current president, Fritz Keller, has been in office since September 2019. In mid-May we met Keller at the DFB’s headquarters in Frankfurt am Main and show him the results of our survey.\n\nKeller looks concerned. He sends a clear message in a time when for-profit football is accused of focusing more on the money than on the health of players. Painkiller abuse is not entirely new to him, said Keller. But at the professional football club SC Freiburg, which he headed for a long time, it was pointed out that the pills should not be taken in advance for possible injuries. “Painkillers as prevention, that’s just stupid.”\n\nBut this is exactly how many amateur footballers use these medications. Keller says that this “shocked” him. “We absolutely have to go to our national associations and simply raise awareness through the trainers.” The DFB’s president summed up the painkiller issue by stating: “This is actually counterproductive. Amateur sports is intended to keep you healthy and not to break you.”\n\nFritz Keller, president of the German Football Association (DFB), said he is “shocked” by survey results that show the widespread use of painkillers among amateur players. The survey was conducted by CORRECTIV and the ARD Doping Editorial Team. © EyeOpening.Media\n\nFor Keller, painkiller abuse is a problem for society as a whole. In regards to football, he said he would “check everything immediately and also draw attention to it in order to keep our athletes healthy”. He also wants to implement whatever measures the DFB is able achieve in this matter.\n\nJust days before publication, the DFB clarified an earlier response to CORRECTIV’s findings about painkiller abuse in football: “Regarding the sensitization of amateur clubs, the DFB is currently planning an online webinar for clubs about the consumption of painkillers with doctor Toni Graf-Baumann”, wrote a representative for the German Football Association in an email. Graf-Baumann, an expert in pain treatment, has been considered an authority about this problem for decades, especially in football associations. He is also a member of DFB’s anti-doping commission. In their written response, the DFB also announced that they will be holding future conversations with the Federal Agency for Health Education.\n\nAs for professional football, the DFB representative wrote there are “no hints” that the consumption of painkillers in German football is different from other professional leagues in Europe. “This careless approach to painkillers and its many risks makes clear that much more educational work is needed.”\n\nFrom the perspective of the two professional football players Neven Subotic and Jonas Hummels, measures against painkiller abuse are also necessary for highly paid players. “As far as I know, there is no major educational work done by clubs because they are also under pressure to get players fit as quickly as possible,” says Subotic. Hummels also believes that “raising such public awareness would really make a lot of sense”."

          "text": "von Marta Orosz\n\nRod Stone is one of the leading experts on VAT carousel fraud worldwide. For 40 years, he battled fraud at the HMRC, the UK’s tax administration, and developed a comprehensive counter strategy. In 2015, he formed his own crime advisory company.\n\nCORRECTIV: The UK managed to reduce the annual loss to the treasury through VAT carousels from £3 billion (€3.4 billion) to roughly £500 million. How was that possible?\n\nStone: In 2005, a number of VAT fraud prosecutions by the tax authorities failed. As a result, I developed something called the ‘abusive right’ principle, which allowed the customs service to disallow import tax claims with respect to people involved in carousel fraud. I was given about three months to see if I could come up with a civil law remedy. We first started using it in January 2006, and by June we had disallowed £3.2 billion worth of import tax claims associated with carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: So that was it – stop the tax claims, and the fraud just stops?\n\nStone: Not quite. In the UK, we used a holistic strategy to combat the fraud. We had a tool box. We looked at all the ways of freezing money, because that also made the environment hostile for them. We would look at insolvency. With insolvency you would identify the missing trader, that’s the importer, and raise a debt against him with the amount of tax that was due. The insolvency practitioner would then take over the running of the missing trader and seek to recover the missing money from everyone else in the ‘supply chain’. The supply chain, of course, was totally contrived and the only person who had any money was the person at the top, the exporter. So most of the insolvency practitioner’s investigations would end up at that point and they would then seek to recover the money. They could also recover the money from the directors personally and they could use worldwide freezing orders to target bank accounts abroad, and that was quite a successful approach. We could obviously also use criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n\nCORRECTIV: How were they different in the UK?\n\nStone: The attraction of carousel fraud in most countries is that it doesn’t carry the same penalties as drug trafficking or bank robbery. Criminals are looking at no more than five years in prison, and by half of that they’ll be out. In the UK, we charge people or indict them with cheating the public revenue, and that carries a life prison sentence. In fact, the longest prison sentence that has been handed out has been 17 years, but it has been quite common for people to be sentenced to between 12 and 14 years for carousel fraud. And if they don’t pay back the stolen money, they’re brought back before the court, and their sentence is increased.\n\nCORRECTIV: How would you and your colleagues chase the fraudsters?\n\nStone: If I suspected that a company was involved in carousel fraud I could send in an officer the same day. That’s part of our UK legislation and doesn’t exist in many EU states. We would get all the sales and purchase records, and from those records we could see who they’ve been buying from. If it’s the first intermediary company above the missing trader, by going to that trader we will identify the missing trader. And at that point, we can go and visit the missing trader. Of course, there won’t be anyone there. It’s just a brass plate on an office block. But by establishing that it’s not a legitimate trading company, we would cancel the VAT registration. We had officers out visiting traders on a daily basis.\n\nBut you knew that as soon as you took out one company and cancelled the VAT registration, within three or four days another company would be registered in its place and ready to go. So you had to continually monitor new company registrations, and who was behind them. We set up a system where every company we suspected of being involved in VAT carousel fraud was asked to clear the details of their suppliers and customers with a special unit in the tax administration. I would come to your office and say, ”I’m instructing you to phone up this office, and tell them every time you’re going to buy from someone new or sell to someone new.” In that way, the tax administration built up a profile of all the companies that were involved — or probably involved — in carousel fraud.\n\nIn addition, if a VAT refund claim was submitted,it was submitted on a monthly basis, and those refund claims would be selected for verification. A verification meant that every transaction on which VAT was being claimed would be tracked down to the missing trader, and nobody got any money until we were satisfied that it wasn’t part of a missing trader scheme.\n\nI have to say there were a lot of legal challenges and we had to go to court frequently to hold our ground, and the courts again were very supportive, because they were aware of the problem, they were aware of the complexities of the fraud and that the tax administration was putting a lot of resources into stopping illegal or illegitimate business without impacting on honest traders.\n\nTax administration HMRC in London. © Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: Why don’t other EU member states act the same way?\n\nStone: The problem is that some of the legislation that countries are using is antiquated. It’s designed to deal with tax evaders, perhaps a man on the street corner who evades a small amount of tax, and the law has never been updated to deal with organized crime. Most of Europe hasn’t kept up with the times. You have to put it through parliament, you have to get people to agree, and many European countries seem to have great difficulty in getting this process through.\n\nLikewise, the courts have to understand what they’re dealing with. In our early prosecutions and our early civil cases, a lot of the judges had difficulty in understanding the issue. We actually had to devise a strategy for delivering the trial to the court case so that everybody understood how the fraud worked. We tried to simplify it. There were large tax companies that were trying to sell VAT carousel fraud as a tax avoidance scheme. Which of course it wasn’t. The tax authorities contacted all the large accountancy firms and re-educated them into what they were dealing with.\n\nCORRECTIV: How can we imagine the prosecution process?\n\nStone: From the time you first become suspicious of the fraud to the date of conviction, you’re looking at between three and five years. In the UK, we have an exemplary prosecution process or strategy. We would only prosecute the cases that had the biggest impact. Some of the major fraud chains were never prosecuted. But they lost their money because we used civil law strategies. There’s only a limited number of investigators. When you conduct a raid and arrest everybody, you need 250 or 500 officers. So there is a big resource implication.\n\nThe prosecution – criminal law — strategy meant that the tax administration had a say in which ones it wanted to prosecute. Some EU member states insist that every identified case of carousel fraud is forwarded to the prosecutor. For that reason, the cases that have been investigated and prosecuted in some EU member countries are more than 10 years old before they come to the court. In the UK we didn’t want stale cases. You probably won’t get much money out of it and it doesn’t send a message to the people currently involved in the fraud. You want to try and do it in real time. As much in real time as you can.\n\nAfter the UK introduced its strategy, the fraudsters looked at other countries in the EU. The VAT carousel fraud became so minimal in comparison with what it had been that we were able to move on to other things. That was until 2009, when the fraudsters moved into the carbon credit market.\n\nCORRECTIV: What happened?\n\nStone: The fraudsters started forming companies in France, and in the last quarter of 2007 they started trading large amounts of carbon credits through the BlueNext exchange in Paris. In January 2009, we became aware of a particular company in the UK selling tens of millions of euros of carbon credits to companies in France. We notified our French colleagues of the trader in France who received the carbon credits. We know from the audit that was carried out by the French audit office that the information wasn’t acted on. In fact, I don’t think the French visited the missing trader for about 5 months. This was largely because French legislation didn’t allow the tax administration to make a visit to a trader until after that trader’s tax return is due. It allowed the fraud to grow and continue in France.\n\nOnce we became aware of the carbon credit fraud in France, it was only a matter of time before it moved to the UK. These things are like the sea. They go across Europe in waves. So we were ready for when the fraud moved. On the day after the French introduced a measure that stopped the carousel, our officers went out and visited something like 30 or 40 traders and cancelled their VAT registration. That doesn’t mean we stopped it. The UK lost about £250 million between May and July 2009, but I suspect we recovered at least half of that through insolvency law and tax law.\n\nCORRECTIV: From the UK, the carbon credit fraud then moved on to Germany where it was only stopped in July 2010. Was the German government not aware of the problem?\n\nStone: In 2009, every EU member state knew about the carbon fraud, certainly by July 2009. There were discussions on it in the Eurofisc and the Europol networks, and there were bilateral exchanges of information. It then became the responsibility of individual member states to take steps to stop it in their country.\n\nCORRECTIV: Why do some member states have so much more difficulty in combatting the fraud than others?\n\nStone: I worked with tax administration throughout Europe, and everybody at the workface was determined to stop the fraud. But they were hampered by the processes and the legislation. Most of it seemed to be antiquated and disjointed, quite frankly. They were unable to act in real time, they lacked the resources in terms of the number of staff with the skills, and it appeared that most EU member states had great difficulty in introducing new legislation.\n\nTake for example the ‘abuse of rights’ principle. It requires the tax administration to demonstrate that the businesses knew or should have known about the fraudulent schemes they were involved in. In the UK, this is an accepted principle. You argue that there is an abuse of the VAT system, and that’s not what the system’s set up for. The UK civil courts do not require that to be written into legislation. In France, there was a requirement for that same argument to be written into the tax code, and that takes time. [In in the UK] I didn’t have to wait for it to go through parliament. As soon as I thought of that as a method of stopping the fraud, we could implement it the next day.\n\nCORRECTIV: Is there a way to stop this kind of fraud entirely?\n\nStone: The only thing that would probably stop it would be to have the same rate of tax throughout Europe on the same commodities. And that wouldn’t be accepted nationally by each individual member state. I suppose that if you end up with a federal Europe, where Brussels has the central European bank and then decides what money is going to be divided up to each individual country and organizes all the collection of the taxes, that would work. But many countries don’t want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\nRod Stone in the interview with CORRECTIV-reporter Marta Orosz © Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: The EU Commission has proposed a new VAT tax scheme, the so-called definitive VAT system. Under the new rules, commodities traded between member states would be taxed in the country where they were sold, and the tax administrations would transfer the taxes between each other. Would that at least reduce the fraud?\n\nStone: Not really. Again, you go back to different tax rates on different goods [as the basis of] carousel fraud. I also know that it doesn’t stop at cross-border trade in the EU. Let’s assume the UK leaves the EU and we become a third country. We, and other countries within the EU, have suddenly introduced postponed accounting on imports from third countries. So what that basically means is that VAT is not collected at the border, it’s going to be deferred. That means that missing trader fraud can start up with countries outside the European Union. So you will get the fraud still operating, potentially, from EU member states to the UK, back into the EU member states. In an effort to ease the burden on business, they’ve actually created other opportunities for carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: You are saying that the door for fraud will always remain open?\n\nStone: Yes. All you can do is deter people from becoming involved. If people are going to be locked up for 15, 16 years and lose all their revenue, they soon stop doing it. So, to my mind, strengthening the ability to collect the money at the earliest opportunity, taking away the assets that the fraudsters have purchased with the money they’ve stolen, and sending them to prison for a very long time, are the only deterrents that exists at the moment.\n\nCORRECTIV: So every member state should create this hostile environment?\n\nStone: There is a responsibility on the European tax directorate to encourage member states to do so and change their legislation. But you’re coming up against cultural barriers. Countries will say, ”But we’ve done it this way for the last hundred years. This is the way our taxpayers expect it to be.” You have to re-educate the taxpayers and say ”the legislation that’s been introduced isn’t targeted at you, the taxpayer, it’s targeted at organized crime”. So, again, it’s all about re-education. You have to re-educate your taxpayers, so that they understand why things are changing, you have to re-educate the judiciary, you need politicians that will change the legislation.\n\nOne of the things the UK did was try to be more proactive to people who don’t put in their tax returns or their VAT returns. We’re now moving to making tax digital in the UK. People will have to start to use the tax digital. That in turn might highlight missing traders more quickly. But you only need to be a missing trader for a day to make £10 million."

You probably won’t get much money out of it and it doesn’t send a message to the people currently involved in the fraud. You want to try and do it in real time. As much in real time as you can.\n\nAfter the UK introduced its strategy, the fraudsters looked at other countries in the EU. The VAT carousel fraud became so minimal in comparison with what it had been that we were able to move on to other things. That was until 2009, when the fraudsters moved into the carbon credit market.\n\nCORRECTIV: What happened?\n\nStone: The fraudsters started forming companies in France, and in the last quarter of 2007 they started trading large amounts of carbon credits through the BlueNext exchange in Paris. In January 2009, we became aware of a particular company in the UK selling tens of millions of euros of carbon credits to companies in France. We notified our French colleagues of the trader in France who received the carbon credits. We know from the audit that was carried out by the French audit office that the information wasn’t acted on. In fact, I don’t think the French visited the missing trader for about 5 months. This was largely because French legislation didn’t allow the tax administration to make a visit to a trader until after that trader’s tax return is due. It allowed the fraud to grow and continue in France.\n\nOnce we became aware of the carbon credit fraud in France, it was only a matter of time before it moved to the UK. These things are like the sea. They go across Europe in waves. So we were ready for when the fraud moved. On the day after the French introduced a measure that stopped the carousel, our officers went out and visited something like 30 or 40 traders and cancelled their VAT registration. That doesn’t mean we stopped it. The UK lost about £250 million between May and July 2009, but I suspect we recovered at least half of that through insolvency law and tax law.\n\nCORRECTIV: From the UK, the carbon credit fraud then moved on to Germany where it was only stopped in July 2010. Was the German government not aware of the problem?\n\nStone: In 2009, every EU member state knew about the carbon fraud, certainly by July 2009. There were discussions on it in the Eurofisc and the Europol networks, and there were bilateral exchanges of information. It then became the responsibility of individual member states to take steps to stop it in their country.\n\nCORRECTIV: Why do some member states have so much more difficulty in combatting the fraud than others?\n\nStone: I worked with tax administration throughout Europe, and everybody at the workface was determined to stop the fraud. But they were hampered by the processes and the legislation. Most of it seemed to be antiquated and disjointed, quite frankly. They were unable to act in real time, they lacked the resources in terms of the number of staff with the skills, and it appeared that most EU member states had great difficulty in introducing new legislation.\n\nTake for example the ‘abuse of rights’ principle. It requires the tax administration to demonstrate that the businesses knew or should have known about the fraudulent schemes they were involved in. In the UK, this is an accepted principle. You argue that there is an abuse of the VAT system, and that’s not what the system’s set up for. The UK civil courts do not require that to be written into legislation. In France, there was a requirement for that same argument to be written into the tax code, and that takes time. [In in the UK] I didn’t have to wait for it to go through parliament. As soon as I thought of that as a method of stopping the fraud, we could implement it the next day.\n\nCORRECTIV: Is there a way to stop this kind of fraud entirely?\n\nStone: The only thing that would probably stop it would be to have the same rate of tax throughout Europe on the same commodities. And that wouldn’t be accepted nationally by each individual member state. I suppose that if you end up with a federal Europe, where Brussels has the central European bank and then decides what money is going to be divided up to each individual country and organizes all the collection of the taxes, that would work. But many countries don’t want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\nRod Stone in the interview with CORRECTIV-reporter Marta Orosz © Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: The EU Commission has proposed a new VAT tax scheme, the so-called definitive VAT system. Under the new rules, commodities traded between member states would be taxed in the country where they were sold, and the tax administrations would transfer the taxes between each other. Would that at least reduce the fraud?\n\nStone: Not really. Again, you go back to different tax rates on different goods [as the basis of] carousel fraud. I also know that it doesn’t stop at cross-border trade in the EU. Let’s assume the UK leaves the EU and we become a third country. We, and other countries within the EU, have suddenly introduced postponed accounting on imports from third countries. So what that basically means is that VAT is not collected at the border, it’s going to be deferred. That means that missing trader fraud can start up with countries outside the European Union. So you will get the fraud still operating, potentially, from EU member states to the UK, back into the EU member states. In an effort to ease the burden on business, they’ve actually created other opportunities for carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: You are saying that the door for fraud will always remain open?\n\nStone: Yes. All you can do is deter people from becoming involved. If people are going to be locked up for 15, 16 years and lose all their revenue, they soon stop doing it. So, to my mind, strengthening the ability to collect the money at the earliest opportunity, taking away the assets that the fraudsters have purchased with the money they’ve stolen, and sending them to prison for a very long time, are the only deterrents that exists at the moment.\n\nCORRECTIV: So every member state should create this hostile environment?\n\nStone: There is a responsibility on the European tax directorate to encourage member states to do so and change their legislation. But you’re coming up against cultural barriers. Countries will say, ”But we’ve done it this way for the last hundred years. This is the way our taxpayers expect it to be.” You have to re-educate the taxpayers and say ”the legislation that’s been introduced isn’t targeted at you, the taxpayer, it’s targeted at organized crime”. So, again, it’s all about re-education. You have to re-educate your taxpayers, so that they understand why things are changing, you have to re-educate the judiciary, you need politicians that will change the legislation.\n\nOne of the things the UK did was try to be more proactive to people who don’t put in their tax returns or their VAT returns. We’re now moving to making tax digital in the UK. People will have to start to use the tax digital. That in turn might highlight missing traders more quickly. But you only need to be a missing trader for a day to make £10 million."

          "text": "In September 2018, an article was published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung which referenced an instance of abuse in Garching. No location and nor names are indicated in the article. However, it describes a case in which the priest in question allegedly abused a 14-year-old boy during confession. At the time, the child’s father noticed how his son began repeatedly destroying the genital areas of plush toys. But the Church didn’t believe the father or his son. According to the FAZ article, the child received psychological treatment. The FAZ writes that the priest and the Church denied the allegation.\n\nBut one Garching resident backed the family’s claims. He was acquainted with the father. Another resident told CORRECTIV that he attended group therapy for people who had been abused with the boy. He said that in one session, the boy, today an adult man, collapsed. Several attempts by CORRECTIV to contact the boy were left unanswered. A spokesperson for diocese of Munich confirmed the instance to CORRECTIV and Frontal21: “The Archiepiscopal Ordinariate of Munich took the traumatization of those affected very seriously and provided financial aid.” The diocese did not comment on the fact that the Church court did not believe the man abused.\n\nAltogether, information from diocese contacted throughout this investigation show that there were “three victims who had concrete accusations” in Garching: One instance that lasted from 1987 to 1993, one in 1994 and another in 1996. Two of the confirmed cases happened concurrent with Auxiliary Bishop von Soden-Fraunhofen’s time as H.’s supervisor, when he repeatedly reported that everything was fine. The diocese wrote that all three cases were closed by the public prosecutor’s office due to the statute of limitations, but that it made payments to the families in two.\n\nPriest Peter H.’s child abuse has not been legally proven in Garching. But the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Munich II is looking into the allegations again and checking “whether there are further acts and whether investigations are to be started,” according to a statement submitted to CORRECTIV.\n\nInsinuations or complaints remain barred by the statute of limitations, and people are still suffering because nobody believes them. However, reports from Essen, Garching, Munich and Grafing show clearly how Priest Peter H. took advantage of young boys: how he created opportunities for himself and abused his power. H. could contribute to the clarification. But he keeps silent.\n\nIn 2018, following emerging scandals, the Catholic Church released an internal study of instances of pastoral abuse. The case of H. is not the only one that shook the German Church. They had documented instances of sexual abuse in Berlin at Canisius College; in Bonn at the Aloisius College; in Aachen at a Benedictine abbey. They also recognized sexual abuse in Ettal and in the choir at the Cathedral of Regensburg. The news of systematic abuse in institutions of the Church came in fast. Cardinal Marx and the German Bishops’ Conference knew they had to act and agreed to have all cases of sexual abuse in Germany after WWII investigated by an independent commission. The study was then presented in Fulda, in Hessen. The names of the victims and of the perpetrators were kept anonymous, but the sheer dimension was devastating. Over 70 years, 1,670 priests and members of the clergy were alleged of sexual abuse. There were 3,677 people who had been abused. Cynically, the study notes that, on average, there were only 2.5 victims for every accused priest. But that’s only the number of cases that had been reported – the true figure may be much higher. A pedophile who is protected by the Church is unlikely to stop after just two or three abuses. The case of Peter H. shows that number of children abused by a single priest can be greater than 10 times that estimate.\n\nIndeed, the findings of this investigation show that it is likely that H. began abusing children earlier than is known and that more boys than assumed are his victims."

          "text": "Finally, Mathias asks Taylor for a private meeting. This is the moment we have been working for over the past few weeks. Taylor sits relaxed in the armchair, his white shirt unbuttoned at the top, with a glass of red wine in his hand.\n\nBusiness talk.\n\nFrom the start, Mathias directs the conversation towards the possibility of donating to groups that deny climate change anonymously. His client, he says, is interested in a long-term investment — but requires that under no circumstances can he be linked to the transactions.\n\nIf the donor does not want to be named, there are some groups in the US, Taylor says. “One is Donors Trust.” You can tell them which group the money should go to – Donors Trust will then channel the funds.\n\nDonors Trust’s activities are not illegal, but they do bypass the otherwise quite extensive transparency regulations in the US. Both Donors Trust and Donors Capital Trust are tax-exempt foundations that redistribute corporate donations to conservative and market-liberal think tanks. US tax law requires them to disclose to whom the funds are given. However, they are allowed to keep the name of the donor undisclosed on the grounds of anonymous. In practice, this means oil and coal companies can support anti-climate campaigns via Donors Trust or Donors Capital without having to reveal their financial support.\n\nIn the past, big players in the fossil industry like Exxon Mobil and Koch brothers were among Heartland’s major donors — but they withdrew public support a few years ago. We checked this by looking at tax returns, which are largely public in the US.\n\nNow, Donors Trust is now one of the association’s biggest donors. The American magazine “Mother Jones” described Donors Trust in 2013 as a “Black Box ATM”. You could say that the foundation lends its name to the actual donors. Taylor confirmed this during the conversation.\n\nDonors Trust is now directing between two thirds and three quarters of its budget to Heartland to support its climate-skeptical positions, says Taylor. He sells this as his personal doing.\n\nSoon after, Taylor starts to speak about the German YouTuber sitting at the table a few meters away.\n\n“We’re looking to bring her on board,” says Taylor, pointing in her direction.\n\nMathias asks: “The young lady?”\n\n“To do some videos for us. Presenting to young people.”\n\nThe young influencer is to start forming new groups. She should be a dropout from mainstream society, with whom as many as young people as possible should identify. According to a Facebook post by the Rhineland-Palatinate Association of “Junge Alternative” (Young Alternative), she is a member of the AfD’s youth organization. The AfD and its members regularly distribute her videos. Taylor says the fight against climate protection measures needs a better image, to move away from old white men and instead showcase a younger generation. The YouTuber is going be the new face of the movement. She is Taylor’s media strategy for the masses.\n\nTaylor also knows how to reach those who are not on YouTube but do vote in parliament. For a long time, he published a monthly brochure that the Heartland Institute sent to politicians.\n\nHe says it was specifically written “We do it as if it were for The New York Times or any other leftist newspaper.”\n\nHe explains that the rule for their editors is to write it as if they were news stories. They cannot write anything that looks like it is opinion. “You present our angle on it, but you do it by who you decide to quote”, he says”.\n\nTaylor’s team uses supposedly journalistic standards to raise doubts about human-induced climate change. What he is not interested is rigor and balance.\n\nAnd he succeeds at that, or at least that’s what he says. There are people who will realise it is Heartland how is writing these articles, he explains, but others feel it is something they could use, and this is how they get to them.\n\nTaylor repeatedly emphasizes the good work done by EIKE. He says it is amazing what they can do in a year with such a small budget, and claims that the organization has 200,000 euros available. They help each other, he says, by participating in each other’s conferences. Heartland also gave EIKE a small sum of money for the Munich conference in late November. When asked about EIKE’s budget, the organization’s representatives said that their “donation volume” per year is “significantly below the stated amount”.\n\nBut whenever Mathias steers the conversation toward our client’s possible investment, Taylor brings his own institution into play — even though Mathias emphasizes several times that the client wants to donate to EIKE because he is mostly concerned about the European market.\n\n“Then he tries to convince me to give my client’s money directly to Heartland, instead of EIKE“, Mathias recalls. Taylor politely adds that EIKE could, of course, use it much better in Europe. Then, a few seconds later, he talks about the benefits of Heartland establishing and disseminating specific information at the request of the client in exchange for money.\n\nA half hour has passed. Taylor and Mathias promise to stay in touch before returning to the other conference goers. Mathias writes down the conversation so he can jog his memory later.\n\nThis is far more than we had hoped for. Taylor has given us a deep insight into the business of climate change deniers. We now know about some of the strategies they use to disseminate disinformation.\n\nBut we want to have it in writing."

          "text": "von Marta Orosz\n\nRod Stone is one of the leading experts on VAT carousel fraud worldwide. For 40 years, he battled fraud at the HMRC, the UK’s tax administration, and developed a comprehensive counter strategy. In 2015, he formed his own crime advisory company.\n\nCORRECTIV: The UK managed to reduce the annual loss to the treasury through VAT carousels from £3 billion (€3.4 billion) to roughly £500 million. How was that possible?\n\nStone: In 2005, a number of VAT fraud prosecutions by the tax authorities failed. As a result, I developed something called the ‘abusive right’ principle, which allowed the customs service to disallow import tax claims with respect to people involved in carousel fraud. I was given about three months to see if I could come up with a civil law remedy. We first started using it in January 2006, and by June we had disallowed £3.2 billion worth of import tax claims associated with carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: So that was it – stop the tax claims, and the fraud just stops?\n\nStone: Not quite. In the UK, we used a holistic strategy to combat the fraud. We had a tool box. We looked at all the ways of freezing money, because that also made the environment hostile for them. We would look at insolvency. With insolvency you would identify the missing trader, that’s the importer, and raise a debt against him with the amount of tax that was due. The insolvency practitioner would then take over the running of the missing trader and seek to recover the missing money from everyone else in the ‘supply chain’. The supply chain, of course, was totally contrived and the only person who had any money was the person at the top, the exporter. So most of the insolvency practitioner’s investigations would end up at that point and they would then seek to recover the money. They could also recover the money from the directors personally and they could use worldwide freezing orders to target bank accounts abroad, and that was quite a successful approach. We could obviously also use criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n\nCORRECTIV: How were they different in the UK?\n\nStone: The attraction of carousel fraud in most countries is that it doesn’t carry the same penalties as drug trafficking or bank robbery. Criminals are looking at no more than five years in prison, and by half of that they’ll be out. In the UK, we charge people or indict them with cheating the public revenue, and that carries a life prison sentence. In fact, the longest prison sentence that has been handed out has been 17 years, but it has been quite common for people to be sentenced to between 12 and 14 years for carousel fraud. And if they don’t pay back the stolen money, they’re brought back before the court, and their sentence is increased.\n\nCORRECTIV: How would you and your colleagues chase the fraudsters?\n\nStone: If I suspected that a company was involved in carousel fraud I could send in an officer the same day. That’s part of our UK legislation and doesn’t exist in many EU states. We would get all the sales and purchase records, and from those records we could see who they’ve been buying from. If it’s the first intermediary company above the missing trader, by going to that trader we will identify the missing trader. And at that point, we can go and visit the missing trader. Of course, there won’t be anyone there. It’s just a brass plate on an office block. But by establishing that it’s not a legitimate trading company, we would cancel the VAT registration. We had officers out visiting traders on a daily basis.\n\nBut you knew that as soon as you took out one company and cancelled the VAT registration, within three or four days another company would be registered in its place and ready to go. So you had to continually monitor new company registrations, and who was behind them. We set up a system where every company we suspected of being involved in VAT carousel fraud was asked to clear the details of their suppliers and customers with a special unit in the tax administration. I would come to your office and say, ”I’m instructing you to phone up this office, and tell them every time you’re going to buy from someone new or sell to someone new.” In that way, the tax administration built up a profile of all the companies that were involved — or probably involved — in carousel fraud.\n\nIn addition, if a VAT refund claim was submitted,it was submitted on a monthly basis, and those refund claims would be selected for verification. A verification meant that every transaction on which VAT was being claimed would be tracked down to the missing trader, and nobody got any money until we were satisfied that it wasn’t part of a missing trader scheme.\n\nI have to say there were a lot of legal challenges and we had to go to court frequently to hold our ground, and the courts again were very supportive, because they were aware of the problem, they were aware of the complexities of the fraud and that the tax administration was putting a lot of resources into stopping illegal or illegitimate business without impacting on honest traders.\n\nTax administration HMRC in London. © Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: Why don’t other EU member states act the same way?\n\nStone: The problem is that some of the legislation that countries are using is antiquated. It’s designed to deal with tax evaders, perhaps a man on the street corner who evades a small amount of tax, and the law has never been updated to deal with organized crime. Most of Europe hasn’t kept up with the times. You have to put it through parliament, you have to get people to agree, and many European countries seem to have great difficulty in getting this process through.\n\nLikewise, the courts have to understand what they’re dealing with. In our early prosecutions and our early civil cases, a lot of the judges had difficulty in understanding the issue. We actually had to devise a strategy for delivering the trial to the court case so that everybody understood how the fraud worked. We tried to simplify it. There were large tax companies that were trying to sell VAT carousel fraud as a tax avoidance scheme. Which of course it wasn’t. The tax authorities contacted all the large accountancy firms and re-educated them into what they were dealing with.\n\nCORRECTIV: How can we imagine the prosecution process?\n\nStone: From the time you first become suspicious of the fraud to the date of conviction, you’re looking at between three and five years. In the UK, we have an exemplary prosecution process or strategy. We would only prosecute the cases that had the biggest impact. Some of the major fraud chains were never prosecuted. But they lost their money because we used civil law strategies. There’s only a limited number of investigators. When you conduct a raid and arrest everybody, you need 250 or 500 officers. So there is a big resource implication.\n\nThe prosecution – criminal law — strategy meant that the tax administration had a say in which ones it wanted to prosecute. Some EU member states insist that every identified case of carousel fraud is forwarded to the prosecutor. For that reason, the cases that have been investigated and prosecuted in some EU member countries are more than 10 years old before they come to the court. In the UK we didn’t want stale cases. You probably won’t get much money out of it and it doesn’t send a message to the people currently involved in the fraud. You want to try and do it in real time. As much in real time as you can.\n\nAfter the UK introduced its strategy, the fraudsters looked at other countries in the EU.

In 2015, he formed his own crime advisory company.\n\nCORRECTIV: The UK managed to reduce the annual loss to the treasury through VAT carousels from £3 billion (€3.4 billion) to roughly £500 million. How was that possible?\n\nStone: In 2005, a number of VAT fraud prosecutions by the tax authorities failed. As a result, I developed something called the ‘abusive right’ principle, which allowed the customs service to disallow import tax claims with respect to people involved in carousel fraud. I was given about three months to see if I could come up with a civil law remedy. We first started using it in January 2006, and by June we had disallowed £3.2 billion worth of import tax claims associated with carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: So that was it – stop the tax claims, and the fraud just stops?\n\nStone: Not quite. In the UK, we used a holistic strategy to combat the fraud. We had a tool box. We looked at all the ways of freezing money, because that also made the environment hostile for them. We would look at insolvency. With insolvency you would identify the missing trader, that’s the importer, and raise a debt against him with the amount of tax that was due. The insolvency practitioner would then take over the running of the missing trader and seek to recover the missing money from everyone else in the ‘supply chain’. The supply chain, of course, was totally contrived and the only person who had any money was the person at the top, the exporter. So most of the insolvency practitioner’s investigations would end up at that point and they would then seek to recover the money. They could also recover the money from the directors personally and they could use worldwide freezing orders to target bank accounts abroad, and that was quite a successful approach. We could obviously also use criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n\nCORRECTIV: How were they different in the UK?\n\nStone: The attraction of carousel fraud in most countries is that it doesn’t carry the same penalties as drug trafficking or bank robbery. Criminals are looking at no more than five years in prison, and by half of that they’ll be out. In the UK, we charge people or indict them with cheating the public revenue, and that carries a life prison sentence. In fact, the longest prison sentence that has been handed out has been 17 years, but it has been quite common for people to be sentenced to between 12 and 14 years for carousel fraud. And if they don’t pay back the stolen money, they’re brought back before the court, and their sentence is increased.\n\nCORRECTIV: How would you and your colleagues chase the fraudsters?\n\nStone: If I suspected that a company was involved in carousel fraud I could send in an officer the same day. That’s part of our UK legislation and doesn’t exist in many EU states. We would get all the sales and purchase records, and from those records we could see who they’ve been buying from. If it’s the first intermediary company above the missing trader, by going to that trader we will identify the missing trader. And at that point, we can go and visit the missing trader. Of course, there won’t be anyone there. It’s just a brass plate on an office block. But by establishing that it’s not a legitimate trading company, we would cancel the VAT registration. We had officers out visiting traders on a daily basis.\n\nBut you knew that as soon as you took out one company and cancelled the VAT registration, within three or four days another company would be registered in its place and ready to go. So you had to continually monitor new company registrations, and who was behind them. We set up a system where every company we suspected of being involved in VAT carousel fraud was asked to clear the details of their suppliers and customers with a special unit in the tax administration. I would come to your office and say, ”I’m instructing you to phone up this office, and tell them every time you’re going to buy from someone new or sell to someone new.” In that way, the tax administration built up a profile of all the companies that were involved — or probably involved — in carousel fraud.\n\nIn addition, if a VAT refund claim was submitted,it was submitted on a monthly basis, and those refund claims would be selected for verification. A verification meant that every transaction on which VAT was being claimed would be tracked down to the missing trader, and nobody got any money until we were satisfied that it wasn’t part of a missing trader scheme.\n\nI have to say there were a lot of legal challenges and we had to go to court frequently to hold our ground, and the courts again were very supportive, because they were aware of the problem, they were aware of the complexities of the fraud and that the tax administration was putting a lot of resources into stopping illegal or illegitimate business without impacting on honest traders.\n\nTax administration HMRC in London. © Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: Why don’t other EU member states act the same way?\n\nStone: The problem is that some of the legislation that countries are using is antiquated. It’s designed to deal with tax evaders, perhaps a man on the street corner who evades a small amount of tax, and the law has never been updated to deal with organized crime. Most of Europe hasn’t kept up with the times. You have to put it through parliament, you have to get people to agree, and many European countries seem to have great difficulty in getting this process through.\n\nLikewise, the courts have to understand what they’re dealing with. In our early prosecutions and our early civil cases, a lot of the judges had difficulty in understanding the issue. We actually had to devise a strategy for delivering the trial to the court case so that everybody understood how the fraud worked. We tried to simplify it. There were large tax companies that were trying to sell VAT carousel fraud as a tax avoidance scheme. Which of course it wasn’t. The tax authorities contacted all the large accountancy firms and re-educated them into what they were dealing with.\n\nCORRECTIV: How can we imagine the prosecution process?\n\nStone: From the time you first become suspicious of the fraud to the date of conviction, you’re looking at between three and five years. In the UK, we have an exemplary prosecution process or strategy. We would only prosecute the cases that had the biggest impact. Some of the major fraud chains were never prosecuted. But they lost their money because we used civil law strategies. There’s only a limited number of investigators. When you conduct a raid and arrest everybody, you need 250 or 500 officers. So there is a big resource implication.\n\nThe prosecution – criminal law — strategy meant that the tax administration had a say in which ones it wanted to prosecute. Some EU member states insist that every identified case of carousel fraud is forwarded to the prosecutor. For that reason, the cases that have been investigated and prosecuted in some EU member countries are more than 10 years old before they come to the court. In the UK we didn’t want stale cases. You probably won’t get much money out of it and it doesn’t send a message to the people currently involved in the fraud. You want to try and do it in real time. As much in real time as you can.\n\nAfter the UK introduced its strategy, the fraudsters looked at other countries in the EU. The VAT carousel fraud became so minimal in comparison with what it had been that we were able to move on to other things. That was until 2009, when the fraudsters moved into the carbon credit market.\n\nCORRECTIV: What happened?\n\nStone: The fraudsters started forming companies in France, and in the last quarter of 2007 they started trading large amounts of carbon credits through the BlueNext exchange in Paris. In January 2009, we became aware of a particular company in the UK selling tens of millions of euros of carbon credits to companies in France. We notified our French colleagues of the trader in France who received the carbon credits. We know from the audit that was carried out by the French audit office that the information wasn’t acted on. In fact, I don’t think the French visited the missing trader for about 5 months. This was largely because French legislation didn’t allow the tax administration to make a visit to a trader until after that trader’s tax return is due. It allowed the fraud to grow and continue in France.\n\nOnce we became aware of the carbon credit fraud in France, it was only a matter of time before it moved to the UK. These things are like the sea. They go across Europe in waves. So we were ready for when the fraud moved. On the day after the French introduced a measure that stopped the carousel, our officers went out and visited something like 30 or 40 traders and cancelled their VAT registration. That doesn’t mean we stopped it. The UK lost about £250 million between May and July 2009, but I suspect we recovered at least half of that through insolvency law and tax law.\n\nCORRECTIV: From the UK, the carbon credit fraud then moved on to Germany where it was only stopped in July 2010. Was the German government not aware of the problem?\n\nStone: In 2009, every EU member state knew about the carbon fraud, certainly by July 2009. There were discussions on it in the Eurofisc and the Europol networks, and there were bilateral exchanges of information. It then became the responsibility of individual member states to take steps to stop it in their country.\n\nCORRECTIV: Why do some member states have so much more difficulty in combatting the fraud than others?\n\nStone: I worked with tax administration throughout Europe, and everybody at the workface was determined to stop the fraud. But they were hampered by the processes and the legislation. Most of it seemed to be antiquated and disjointed, quite frankly. They were unable to act in real time, they lacked the resources in terms of the number of staff with the skills, and it appeared that most EU member states had great difficulty in introducing new legislation.\n\nTake for example the ‘abuse of rights’ principle. It requires the tax administration to demonstrate that the businesses knew or should have known about the fraudulent schemes they were involved in. In the UK, this is an accepted principle. You argue that there is an abuse of the VAT system, and that’s not what the system’s set up for. The UK civil courts do not require that to be written into legislation. In France, there was a requirement for that same argument to be written into the tax code, and that takes time. [In in the UK] I didn’t have to wait for it to go through parliament. As soon as I thought of that as a method of stopping the fraud, we could implement it the next day.\n\nCORRECTIV: Is there a way to stop this kind of fraud entirely?\n\nStone: The only thing that would probably stop it would be to have the same rate of tax throughout Europe on the same commodities. And that wouldn’t be accepted nationally by each individual member state. I suppose that if you end up with a federal Europe, where Brussels has the central European bank and then decides what money is going to be divided up to each individual country and organizes all the collection of the taxes, that would work. But many countries don’t want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\nRod Stone in the interview with CORRECTIV-reporter Marta Orosz © Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: The EU Commission has proposed a new VAT tax scheme, the so-called definitive VAT system. Under the new rules, commodities traded between member states would be taxed in the country where they were sold, and the tax administrations would transfer the taxes between each other. Would that at least reduce the fraud?\n\nStone: Not really. Again, you go back to different tax rates on different goods [as the basis of] carousel fraud. I also know that it doesn’t stop at cross-border trade in the EU. Let’s assume the UK leaves the EU and we become a third country. We, and other countries within the EU, have suddenly introduced postponed accounting on imports from third countries. So what that basically means is that VAT is not collected at the border, it’s going to be deferred. That means that missing trader fraud can start up with countries outside the European Union. So you will get the fraud still operating, potentially, from EU member states to the UK, back into the EU member states. In an effort to ease the burden on business, they’ve actually created other opportunities for carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: You are saying that the door for fraud will always remain open?\n\nStone: Yes. All you can do is deter people from becoming involved. If people are going to be locked up for 15, 16 years and lose all their revenue, they soon stop doing it. So, to my mind, strengthening the ability to collect the money at the earliest opportunity, taking away the assets that the fraudsters have purchased with the money they’ve stolen, and sending them to prison for a very long time, are the only deterrents that exists at the moment.\n\nCORRECTIV: So every member state should create this hostile environment?\n\nStone: There is a responsibility on the European tax directorate to encourage member states to do so and change their legislation. But you’re coming up against cultural barriers. Countries will say, ”But we’ve done it this way for the last hundred years. This is the way our taxpayers expect it to be.” You have to re-educate the taxpayers and say ”the legislation that’s been introduced isn’t targeted at you, the taxpayer, it’s targeted at organized crime”. So, again, it’s all about re-education. You have to re-educate your taxpayers, so that they understand why things are changing, you have to re-educate the judiciary, you need politicians that will change the legislation.\n\nOne of the things the UK did was try to be more proactive to people who don’t put in their tax returns or their VAT returns. We’re now moving to making tax digital in the UK. People will have to start to use the tax digital. That in turn might highlight missing traders more quickly. But you only need to be a missing trader for a day to make £10 million."

          "text": "The story of Amir B. shows how a clever teenager rose from mobile phone trader to tax carousel lynchpin within just a few years. Following his tracks reveals the structure of the fraud system and the difficulties the authorities face in the war against VAT fraud.\n\nMost people don’t realize why it’s so much cheaper to buy mobile phones on eBay rather than from the manufacturer direct. But not Amir Baha (name changed) who understood perfectly when as a 16-year-old schoolboy he started selling mobiles in a city in Germany’s North Rhine Westphalia. “All around the world people know: if you want to sell mobiles in Germany, they have to come from fraud. Otherwise there’s no money in it.” That’s how he summed it up nearly a decade later to prosecutors in Cologne.\n\nBaha was a smart kid who rose to be a multi-millionaire in the space of a few short years. He was at home at Dubai’s nightclubs and flew first class. He traded mobile phones, game consoles, copper electrodes and even certificates for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. At the time of his arrest, he was running eleven companies registered in other people’s names.\n\nHe did not, however, earn his money from mark-ups on these products but from the tax he stole. By moving his merchandise in circles across borders and without paying value-added tax (VAT), he siphoned off millions from state coffers, tricking the authorities into paying him and his partners money they weren’t owed. Opinions differ as to how much exactly. Insiders estimate €110 million, one prosecutor puts the number at €60 million, a court verdict against Baha at €40 million.\n\nIn any case, a huge amount for somebody who traded in mobile phones. An employee with an above-average salary of €5,000 per month would have to work 1,600 years to earn €100 million. In his crowd, however, Baha was only a medium-sized player.\n\nThis kind of crime, dubbed ‘VAT carousels’ or Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud, is costing Germany from €5 billion at the low end of estimates to anything up to €14 billion annually. As Europe’s largest economy, the losses are higher than elsewhere. But VAT fraud carousels are an EU-wide problem with the EU commission fixing the total annual tax loss at around €50 billion.\n\nIn October last year, CORRECTIV published its investigation into the highly complex share deals known as Cum-Ex, which are designed to ‘reclaim’ tax that was never in fact paid. The Cum-Ex operators require the assistance of teams of highly sophisticated lawyers and bankers to help engineer the trades. By contrast, VAT fraud, some reckon, is Cum-Ex for the masses.\n\nEven teenagers such as Baha can advance from small-time mobile phone seller to multi-millionaire within a couple of years. For the public, the result is the same: billions of tax money ends up in criminals’ pockets rather than going into hospitals, schools and law enforcement.\n\n“Why people would do any other form of criminality, I don’t know,” says Rod Stone, a former British tax investigator and one of Europe’s leading authorities on the subject. “Why do drugs, why do anything else when they can make so much money out of this?” Stone also questions why hardly any European countries are taking the problem seriously despite the enormous losses. VAT fraud is off the political agenda and rarely makes it into the headlines."

          "title": "Boris Johnson incorrect to say Keir Starmer is “completely wrong” about past trends in child poverty",
          "text": "Boris Johnson incorrect to say Keir Starmer is “completely wrong” about past trends in child poverty\n\nCorrect - this refers to the number of children living in low income households as defined by the government.\n\nThe government’s Social Mobility Commission concluded there are 600,000 more children living in relative poverty than in 2012.\n\nThis is based on an estimate made in 2017 which estimated child poverty would be considerably higher by this point than it is. For that reason it shouldn’t be considered relevant today.\n\nThe government’s Social Mobility Commission said the number of children in poverty is expected to increase to 5.2 million by 2022.\n\nGovernment figures show that relative low income was at the same level in 2018/19 as in 2009/10 while absolute low income fell by one percentage point. Another measure of poverty, produced by the Social Metrics Commission, does show a fall under this government.\n\nWe don’t know where this data comes from and have asked the government.\n\nThere are 400,000 fewer families living in poverty now than there were in 2010.\n\nKeir Starmer: “Can I also welcome the Prime Minister's latest U-turn. This time on free school meals. That was the right thing to do, and it is vital to the 1.3 million children who will benefit. “A report last week from the government's Social Mobility Commission concluded that there are now 600,000 more children living in relative poverty than in 2012. The report went on to say child poverty rates are projected to increase to 5.2 million by 2022.” Boris Johnson: “He's completely wrong in what he says about poverty. Absolute poverty, relative poverty have both declined under this government and there are hundreds of thousands, I think 400,000 fewer families living in poverty now than there were in 2010.” Prime Minister’s Questions, 17 June 2020\n\nAt this week’s Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson and Labour leader Keir Starmer appeared to quote contradictory figures about poverty in the UK.\n\nWhile it’s clear from the exchanges what source Mr Starmer was using, it’s unclear what measure of poverty the Prime Minister was referring to when he said that it was down 400,000 since 2010, or whether he was talking about child poverty—as Mr Starmer had been—or overall poverty. We’ve asked Downing Street for more information.\n\nKeir Starmer correctly quotes poverty figures from a government report—but they don't reflect the whole picture\n\nMr Johnson is incorrect to say that Keir Starmer is completely wrong about poverty. Mr Starmer’s figures are taken directly from a report by the government’s Social Mobility Commission (SMoC).\n\nThe SMoC uses government data on people living in low-income households as a measure of poverty, which shows that, since 2011/12 and up to 2018/19, the number of children in relative poverty has risen by about 600,000.\n\nThis is the number of children living in households where the income after housing costs is less than 60% of the national median average.\n\nIt’s worth saying that there are a lot of different measures of poverty and this is not necessarily the best one. For example, it doesn’t consider costs not related to housing that might affect a household’s income, such as childcare. In other words, it’s not a definitive figure for what’s been happening to child poverty, regardless of the fact that the SMoC and Labour have chosen to highlight it.\n\nWe’ve written about the different ways you can measure poverty before.\n\nMr Starmer also claimed that child poverty was projected to rise to 5.2 million by 2022. This is also from the SMoC report, which seems to quote estimates based on projections made by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in 2017. The IFS projected that child poverty would rise from 30% in 2015/16 to 37% in 2021/22. But if the projections had played out for real, then we’d expect child poverty to be at around 35% by now. Given that relative child poverty is still 30% (unchanged since 2015/16), we don’t think these projections are still valid.\n\nMr Johnson’s figures don’t refute Mr Starmer’s, but there are measures which back the government up\n\nAfter saying Mr Starmer was wrong, Mr Johnson said that absolute poverty and relative poverty are both down “under this government.” By this we presume the Prime Minister was either talking about the change since 2009/10 (the last year of the Labour government) or the change since 2010/11 (the first year of the Coalition government).\n\nThe exact picture depends on the measure you look at.\n\nGovernment figures show that relative low income was at the same rate in 2018/19 (22% of the population) as in 2009/10 and slightly higher than it was in 2010/11. Meanwhile absolute low income fell by one percentage point (to 20%) comparing to either 2009/10 or 2010/11. All these figures are after taking housing costs into account.\n\nIn terms of numbers of people, relative low income was higher by about one million compared to 2009/10, or 1.5 million comparing to 2010/11. Absolute low income was at very similar levels.\n\nRelative poverty as measured by the Social Metrics Commission (an independent research body set up to create a new measure of poverty, not to be confused with the Social Mobility Commission we mentioned above), shows about 600,000 fewer people are in poverty in 2017/18 (the latest year’s data) compared to 2009/10. Measuring since 2010/11, the fall is closer to 300,000.\n\nMr Johnson also claimed that there are 400,000 fewer families living in poverty than in 2010. The Labour shadow minister for child poverty strategy said after the session that the Prime Minister was wrong about child poverty, seemingly referring to this exchange. This is also how the Independent appeared to interpret this exchange.\n\nMr Johnson didn’t actually specify he was talking about “child poverty” though, even though this is what Mr Starmer had been asking about.\n\nWe’ve already fact checked a similar claim Mr Johnson made before when he explicitly claimed that child poverty is down 400,000, and found this to be incorrect. At the moment, the main measures of child poverty or children in low income households show anything from a fall of about 100,000 to a rise of 600,000 since 2009/10 or 2010/11 (the same figure that the SMoC featured in their report).\n\nIf Mr Johnson is talking about overall poverty here, then this claim is a fair one, on balance, although it still only gives part of the picture. The figures from the Social Metrics Commission which we mentioned above roughly back him up, though the government’s low income figures don’t.\n\nThe Social Metrics Commission’s measure is probably a better measure of poverty, as we’ve discussed before.We’ve assumed Mr Johnson is talking about individuals in poverty rather than “families” as he specified during exchanges, as these are usually how poverty figures are provided.\n\nIt’s correct that at least 1.3 million children will benefit from the government’s new policy on free school meals\n\nKeir Starmer also said during the exchanges that 1.3 million children will benefit from the government’s recent u-turn over giving free school meals to children over the summer holidays, off the back of a campaign by England footballer Marcus Rashford.\n\n1.3 million children in England were eligible for and claiming free school meals, in 2019. Additionally the government has extended eligibility for its voucher scheme to children of groups that have “no recourse to public funds”, people in the UK with temporary immigration status. So the potential beneficiaries of the government’s decision to continue the scheme over the summer may be higher than 1.3 million.\n\nThere additionally may be some children who are eligible for free school meals but do not claim them."

          "text": "A Norweigan-British research paper doesn’t claim the virus causing Covid-19 was man-made\n\nA Norweigan virologist has made claims about the non-natural origins of the new coronavirus. But this claim is not in a new peer-reviewed paper he co-authored. The scientific community widely agrees that the virus was not artificially engineered.\n\n“Sørensen and Dagleish say that the RNA sequence of the virus includes inserts which could not have occurred naturally in zoonotic [animal] transfer. Now for the benefit of non-scientists...that means the coronavirus was engineered in a laboratory.” Allison Pearson, The Telegraph’s Planet Normal podcast, 3 June 2020\n\nDuring a podcast interview, Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson and her guest, Sir Richard Dearlove (Chief of MI6 between 1999 and 2004), discussed a new research paper on a potential coronavirus vaccine.\n\nMs Pearson claims that two of the paper’s authors, Birger Sørensen and Angus Dalgleish say that the genetic sequence of the virus means it “was engineered in a laboratory.” Sir Richard then suggests that these claims were included in the paper discussed, which has been “peer-reviewed and printed in a journal which is most prestigious.”\n\nThese claims were, reportedly, in an earlier draft of the paper, and Dr Sørensen has since repeated them to Norweigan press.\n\nHowever, the final version of the research paper, which has undergone peer review and been accepted for publication in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, doesn’t actually make any claims about whether the virus was natural or man-made in its current form.\n\nWhat does the research paper say?\n\nThe paper has three authors: Andres Susrud and Dr Sørensen who work at Immunor AS, a Norweigan company that created a potential Covid-19 vaccine the paper is assessing, and Professor Dalgleish, a Professor of Oncology at St George’s University of London. According to the paper, all three authors own shares or have stock options in the company.\n\nThe paper begins with a discussion of how the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, came about. The study says that this is an important first step because “mistaken assumptions” about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 “risk creating ineffective or actively harmful vaccines”.\n\nWithin this section, the study authors write about data showing that there are “inserted sections placed on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike surface”, which may explain how the virus binds with human cells. The paper in its current published and peer-reviewed form doesn’t say this couldn’t have occurred naturally.\n\nProfessor Anne Spurkland, an immunologist from the University of Oslo who was not an author on the paper, told NRK, the Norweigan state broadcaster, that this is not evidence that the virus was man-made. Another vaccine researcher, Gunnveig Grødeland, who was also not involved in the paper, told NRK that these sequences can occur when a virus mutates and are found in other viruses including HIV and other coronaviruses.\n\nSo where did these claims come from?\n\nThe Telegraph reports that “an earlier version of the paper that it has seen concluded that coronavirus should correctly be called \"Wuhan virus\" and claimed to have proven \"beyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered”.\n\nIn the podcast interview, Sir Richard says that the paper “has been rewritten many times”.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, the paper was initially rejected by leading academic journals, and “was watered down to remove explicit accusations against China, and the rewritten study was then judged to be of sufficient scientific merit.” The Telegraph also writes that “one of the authors, John Fredrik Moxnes, the chief scientific adviser to the Norwegian military, asked for his name to be withdrawn from the research, throwing its credibility into doubt.”\n\nA few days after the Telegraph story was published, NRK published an article in which they spoke to co-author of the paper, Dr Sørensen about the origins of the new coronavirus. It reported that “according to the researchers [Sørensen and Dagleish] sequences in this protein may indicate that the virus does not have a natural origin.”\n\nIn the same interview, Dr Sørensen refutes having papers rejected as reported by the Telegraph, saying that the work was divided into two. The published paper, referred to above, is about vaccine development, whilst the second “goes deeper into the question of whether the virus is man-made” and is yet to be published.\n\nSeveral corrections now appear at the top of that NRK article, including the clarification that the claim that “sequences in the coronavirus spike protein appear to be artificially inserted” was not from the research article but “based on statements from Sørensen to NRK”. These were added after the Norweigan fact checker, Faktisk, asked NRK questions about the article.\n\nAs we have written about before, it is widely agreed by scientists that the new coronavirus came from an animal source and could not have been engineered in a lab."

This means they have no access to the majority of welfare benefits, including Universal Credit as Mr Timms said.\n\nOrdinarily, this would mean that children in this category would not qualify for free school meals as it is usually just based on whether the child’s family is in receipt of certain benefits.\n\nHowever the government has said: “During the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, we are temporarily extending free school meals eligibility to include some groups who have no recourse to public funds (NRPF).”\n\nThose groups are children of “Zambrano carers” (where the child is a British citizen), children of families with a right to remain under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and children of families receiving support under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989.\n\nWe’ve asked the Department for Education what proportion of children with no recourse to public funds this covers and will update this piece if we receive a reply.\n\nFor children not attending school due to the pandemic, and over the holidays, food vouchers are being substituted for meals in school."

          "text": "What did lockdown rules say when these Labour MPs are claimed to have broken them?\n\nWe’ve seen it claimed multiple times that several Labour MPs broke lockdown rules.\n\nAs we’ve said before, there is a difference between the law that enforces lockdown and government guidance. This article is going to primarily look at guidance, but we will mention the laws. Many aspects of the following cases fall into grey areas between guidance, the law, and people’s personal situations.\n\nIn March, Labour MP for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock posted a photo of himself sitting outside his father’s home in London. Mr Kinnock was urged to comply with the lockdown by South Wales Police at the time, particularly around essential travel. The MP defended his actions, saying he was delivering essential items.\n\nAt the time guidance said that people should only leave their homes for a handful of reasons, one was “to provide care or to help a vulnerable person”. The guidance on shielding also said that friends and family could be called on to support vulnerable people in getting food and medicines. We don’t know Mr Kinnock’s or his family’s personal circumstances, however, the law also stated that someone could leave their home if assisting a vulnerable person. As both of Mr Kinnock’s parents are over 70, they fall under the legislation's definition of “vulnerable”.\n\nLabour MP Tahir Ali was criticised for attending a funeral along with a large group in April. Police attended the gathering at the time and took no further action. He said he was attending the services as an observer, which went against funeral guidance at that time, which stated only close family or co-habitants should attend a funeral, or if none of these could attend then a “modest number” of close friends could attend. He has acknowledged that his actions were wrong.\n\nMP Kevan Jones was criticised for attending a birthday party in his constituency in early May. Mr Jones claimed at the time that the police were aware of the gathering, as was the local mayor who reportedly helped organise the event. Full Fact has contacted Stanley police to confirm this. At the time, the government and legislation still said that public gatherings of more than two people were prohibited unless they lived in the same household, it was for work purposes, to attend a funeral, it was necessary to help someone move house, provide care to a vulnerable person, to give emergency assistance or undertake legal proceedings.\n\nWelsh Labour Health Minister Vaughn Gething was pictured on 9 May eating chips on a park bench. He said at the time the act was within the “rules” and this was also the position of the Welsh government in comments reported by The Sun. We don’t know the exact circumstances of Mr Gethin’s walk or his stop to eat chips.\n\nAt the time the photograph was reportedly taken, Welsh government guidelines said: “Going for a walk and then having a picnic or spending a prolonged period on a park bench, for example, is not considered to be exercise and is not intended to be a reasonable excuse.”\n\nGovernment advice on exercising was then updated on 11 May. From that date it said “Going for a walk and also stopping to have something to eat or sit in a park” was allowed, so long as more time was spent exercising than eating."

          "title": "Yes, patients were discharged to care homes without Covid-19 tests",
          "text": "Yes, patients were discharged to care homes without Covid-19 tests\n\nWe’ve been asked by readers whether it was government policy on 19 March to send hospital patients back into care homes, without making it mandatory for them to be tested for Covid-19.\n\nThis is correct. There was no requirement to test all patients being discharged from hospital into a care home until 15 April 2020, though some trusts were testing patients before that date.\n\nWhat did the guidance say?\n\nOn 17 March, NHS England and NHS Improvement wrote to trusts telling them to “expand critical care capacity to the maximum” by freeing up beds. This was to ensure the NHS had the capacity it needed to treat Covid-19 patients in the coming weeks and months.\n\nTo that end, trusts were told to postpone all non-urgent operations and to “urgently discharge all hospital inpatients who are medically fit to leave.” This included some inpatients who would then be discharged to a care home.\n\nNHS Providers, which is the association of trusts and foundation trusts in England, says: “NHS England and Improvement made this decision having just witnessed the health and care system in Northern Italy being overwhelmed by Covid-19 demand.”\n\nTwo days later, the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England and Improvement published the discharge requirements in detail.\n\nThere was no requirement to test everyone who was discharged to see if they were infected. The document said that, where applicable, Covid-19 test results should be included in the documentation that accompanied people who were discharged.\n\nOn 2 April, the government reiterated in new guidance that “any [care home] resident presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 should be promptly isolated” but specified that “negative tests are not required prior to transfers / admissions into the care home.”\n\nThis was the situation up to 15 April, when the government published its adult social care action plan which said that trusts would need to test all patients prior to being discharged and admitted into a care home.\n\nThis was required whether or not the patient had Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nThe government acknowledged that some people may still be moved into a care home, while having the illness, as “some care providers will be able to accommodate these individuals through effective isolation strategies or cohorting strategies.”\n\nWhat actually happened?\n\nNHS Providers says: “Trusts were already testing patients and care home residents with symptoms wherever testing capacity allowed, but this capacity was not reliably and consistently available across the country before mid-April.”\n\nHowever, Covid-19 can be spread by people without symptoms. Trusts said that, for a few days following 17 March, “small numbers of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients may have been discharged into care homes.”\n\nSeveral trusts say they stopped that quickly and moved to a system whereby all discharges to care homes, regardless of symptoms were tested and isolated within care homes pending their test results.\n\nSo while the guidance didn’t require for patients discharged into care homes to be tested until 15 April, that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t happening. The testimony from NHS trusts seems to be that very few people discharged into care homes were reintroduced to the care home population without being tested.\n\nNHS Providers said it spoke to a range of trust leaders to understand this, but it should be noted that this sort of testimony might not represent how all trusts behaved.\n\nAlso, even if trusts did not ‘systematically’ and ‘knowingly’ discharge patients they knew or suspected had COVID-19 into care homes, as has been reported, that doesn’t close off the possibility that these discharges contributed to the disease spreading in care homes.\n\nFor example, we know that care homes have struggled to get the adequate amount of personal protective equipment, meaning that even patients isolated in care homes may have been able to spread the disease into the care home more widely via an inadequately protected care worker."

          "text": "A viral post on autopsies, Italy and the new coronavirus has many inaccuracies\n\nA viral post on Facebook has made a number of claims about Italy’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe almost 1,000 word long post begins:\n\n“Well! Well! Well! People are Waking up! Italy went against the WHO, saying no autopies [sic] on Covid-19, (wonder why?) Italy Did 50 autopsies and here's something you all need to read, before the nonexpert experts from FB delete it!”\n\nThe post claims, amongst other things, that Italy went against the WHO to perform post-mortems on Covid-19 patients, and found the disease is caused by a bacteria that causes blood clotting, not a virus.\n\nAlmost all of the claims it makes are incorrect.\n\n“Italy went against the WHO, saying no autopies [sic] on Covid-19”\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) did not say that post mortems shouldn’t be performed on people who died with Covid-19. The WHO released guidance on 24 March on safety measures for managing bodies and performing post-mortems on patients who had died of Covid-19. This guidance does not say autopsies should not take place.\n\nItaly did perform post mortems on patients who had died of Covid-19, though on 1 April the Ministry of Health recommended against doing autopsies on patients who clearly had the disease. Post-mortems are also allowed to take place on Covid-19 patients in other countries, including the UK and China.\n\n“Italy has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium. It clots the blood and reduces the oxygen saturation from dispersing throughout the body.”\n\nCovid-19 is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2, not a bacteria. Scientists have been studying the disease and its cause for several months now, and have sequenced the genetic material of the virus. (However, it is the case that people with Covid-19 can get secondary infections caused by bacteria, which can be very dangerous.)\n\nAs we’ve written before, severe Covid-19 can cause blood clotting problems.\n\n“[Italy] started using aspirin 100mg and a coagulant medication. And have had immense success. 14,000 people were released from the hospital as healthy and covid free.”\n\nThe Italian Medicines Agency makes no mention of aspirin on its page about drugs being used outside of clinical trials to treat patients with Covid-19. The agency’s list of clinical trials in Italy on potential treatments for Covid-19 does not explicitly mention aspirin either. There is at least one study into using aspirin to treat Covid-19, although that’s not taking place in Italy.\n\nIt’s true that an anticoagulant called heparin, which is normally used to prevent blood clots, has been given to Covid-19 patients in Italy in certain circumstances.\n\nIt’s not clear what the post means when it mentions 14,000 having been released from hospital healthy in Italy. At the time of writing just under 170,000 people in Italy had recovered from Covid-19.\n\n“Italy is demanding Bill Gates and the World health Organization be held accountable for crimes against humanity for misleading, misdirecting, and withholding life saving information from the world, which cost the lives of thousands.”\n\nThis seems to be referring to the case of an Italian MP, Sara Cunial, making a speech in which she told the Italian Prime Minister to send Bill Gates to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Ms Cunial is not currently a member of any political party, and her speech was not endorsed by the Italian government.\n\n“Autopsies performed by the Italian pathologists has shown that it is not pneumonia but it is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Thrombosis) which ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.”\n\nAs we have written before, it is incorrect to say that Covid-19 patients have been misdiagnosed with pneumonia when they have disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nPneumonia is a common complication of severe Covid-19, and disseminated intravascular coagulation can also be present in Covid-19 pneumonia patients.\n\nAs for the treatments, there is not yet a specific cure for Covid-19 that has been proved to be effective.\n\nAntibiotics are not used to directly treat viruses, so are not used for Covid-19, although in some cases are given to patients if they are also suffering from bacterial infections. Some antivirals are being tested to see how effective they might be at treating Covid-19, and one, remdesivir, is being given to certain patients in the UK.\n\nThe anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen is being tested to see whether it can help Covid-19 patients, and the anticoagulant heparin has been used in some cases to treat Covid-19 illness.\n\n“[There was] a Mexican family in the United States who claimed they were cured with a home remedy was documented: three 500 mg aspirins dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey, taken hot.”\n\nThis has no basis in fact. Home remedies, including those involving lemon and honey, have no power to cure Covid-19 or prevent it. Hot water with lemon and honey can soothe a cough, but has no power to cure the new coronavirus. Aspirin can be used for pain relief in adults if they have a cough or cold, but you should not take as many as three 500mg in one go. Tablets are usually 300mg and the usual dose is one or two every four to six hours.\n\nWe could find no record of a family in Mexico claiming to have been cured in this way. Other posts claim the home remedy is an Italian or Cuban invention.\n\n“An Italian pathologist reports that the hospital in Bergamo did a total of 50 autopsies and one in Milan, 20, that is, the Italian series is the highest in the world, the Chinese did only 3”.\n\nWe can’t find a specific report describing 50 autopsies being done on Covid-19 patients at a hospital in Bergamo. One study, published in the Lancet, looked at 38 samples from Covid-19 patients who died at hospitals in Bergamo and Milan.\n\nContrary to what the post claims, there have been more than three autopsies of Covid-19 patients in China.\n\n“According to the Italian pathologist, treatment in ICUs is useless if thromboembolism is not resolved first. “If we ventilate a lung where blood does not circulate, it is useless, in fact, nine (9) patients out of ten (10) will die because the problem is cardiovascular, not respiratory.””\n\nThromboembolism, which is a type of blood clot, is one of several potential complications that can arise in severely ill Covid-19 patients. It’s not known exactly how many Covid-19 patients die of this, as opposed to respiratory failure, or organ failure. Several of these can also occur at once in the same patient.\n\nWhether or not a Covid-19 hospital patient goes into ICU depends not just on what complications they have, but how ill they are, how closely they need to be monitored, as well as the capacity and policy of the hospital they’re in.\n\n“Unfortunately, what the scientific literature said, especially Chinese, until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used.”\n\nWe could not find peer-reviewed studies that questioned the safety of ibuprofen in Covid-19 patients, or any specifically that came from China.\n\nHowever, it’s correct that there has been some debate over whether anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, should be used in patients with Covid-19.\n\nIn the UK, initially, the NHS said that those self-isolating with symptoms could take painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, except those who have been specifically told by their doctors not to.\n\nIn mid-March, the NHS changed its guidance, and stopped advising people to use ibuprofen. It said that although there was “currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (Covid-19) worse”, it recommended using paracetamol to treat the symptoms “until we have more information”.\n\nNow, the NHS says that ibuprofen is fine to use if you have symptoms, although it advises that people should try paracetamol first, as it is “the safer choice for most people”.\n\n“The main problem is not the virus, but the immune hyperreaction that destroys the cell where the virus is installed.”\n\nIt’s true that in some patients, the immune system can overreact to the infection, and cause inflammation that can lead to organ failure. This is known as a cytokine storm. But not all the evidence points to this being present, or the cause of death, in all critically ill patients.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

          "text": "Quick Take\n\nHeadlines on social media misleadingly suggest that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi violated a military tradition when she gave a folded flag to the brother of George Floyd. A folded flag is not “Reserved Only For Fallen Veterans,” as one headline claims. Members of Congress routinely present flags that have flown over the U.S. Capitol as gifts.\n\nFull Story\n\nPhilonise Floyd — the brother of George Floyd, who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis in late May — testified before the House Judiciary Committee on June 10 during a hearing on police practices and law enforcement accountability.\n\nDuring Philonise Floyd’s visit to the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gifted him a folded, encased U.S. flag — as a photo posted on her official Facebook and Twitter accounts shows.\n\n“Philonise Floyd’s heart-wrenching testimony to the House Judiciary Committee left its mark on us all. May this flag, which flew over the Capitol on the day of his brother’s murder, serve as a symbol of our shared commitment to securing justice for George and all victims of police violence,” her Facebook post said.\n\nHeadlines that circulated on social media in the days after, however, misleadingly suggested that Pelosi’s act trampled on a tradition that reserved the gifting of a folded flag only for military families.\n\nThe conspiracy theory website InfoWars, in a June 15 story that was republished by teaparty.org, declared: “Pelosi Gifts George Floyd’s Brother Folded American Flag Reserved Only For Fallen Veterans.”\n\nA headline on NeonNettle.com on June 16 echoed the claim: “Pelosi Gifts George Floyd’s Brother Folded American Flag Meant for Fallen Military.”\n\nThe InfoWars story goes on to claim that “[f]olded American flags are traditionally presented by the U.S. government to families of fallen veterans during military funerals” and cites “specific criteria necessary to receive a folded American flag” from the U.S. Veterans Affairs website. It claims Floyd’s family “does not fall into the listed criteria of eligible recipients.”\n\nThere are indeed criteria for those eligible to receive burial flags from Veterans Affairs; the flags are provided at no cost for the funeral of veterans and typically are given to the next-of-kin as a keepsake afterward.\n\nBut there’s nothing that precludes Pelosi, or any other American citizen, from gifting a flag — or folding it.\n\n“There are no prescriptive rules saying you can’t give a flag to anyone,” said Scot Guenter, senior director of the Flag Research Center and professor emeritus of American Studies at San Jose State University. “The whole point of the American flag is that we don’t live in a society that says you can’t use the flag.”\n\nGuenter, who wrote the book, “The American Flag, 1777-1924: Cultural Shifts from Creation to Codification,” also told us in a phone interview that folding a flag is a sign of respect for it.\n\nThere is also no mention in the U.S. “Flag Code,” whose provisions Guenter said are “rules of etiquette,” of who is allowed to gift a flag.\n\n“While the Department of Veterans Affairs provides a casket flag for all honorable veterans and the military service provides them for active-duty service members upon their death, the U.S. Flag Code does not prohibit or limit a flag draping the coffin to any specific group,” John Raughter, a spokesman for the American Legion, a veterans association, told us in an email. “Traditionally though, as the flag is provided for veterans and active-duty service members, it has come to represent a veteran funeral rite.”\n\nRaughter added that “there is no rule about who may receive a flag as a gift. We encourage the display of the flag of the United States by all citizens of the United States. Now while there is no rule for it, traditionally a flag is folded into a triangle when it is not flown and may be stored in a presentation case if a particular flag has special meaning.”\n\n“So presenting someone with a flag, folded into a triangle and placed into a display case is an honorable way of presenting and maintaining the flag of the United States,” he said.\n\nFlags that are flown over the Capitol — as was the case with the one given to Philonise Floyd — are, in fact, routinely requested by the offices of members of Congress through the Capitol Flag Program, which started in the 1930s.\n\nThe program, under the Architect of the Capitol, allows members of the public to purchase such flags through House and Senate offices; many members of Congress have instructions on their websites for ordering a flag for any occasion. The Architect of the Capitol “fulfills on average more than 100,000 flag requests from Members of Congress annually, with the number of requests and the popularity of the Capitol Flag Program growing steadily each year,” according to the program’s website.\n\nAnd, according to the House Members’ Congressional Handbook, members can use such flags as official gifts.\n\n“U.S. flags flown over the Capitol for official presentation as a gift, including the flag flying fee, are reimbursable,” the handbook says. “Such flags must be for the personal use of or display by the recipient (examples may include, but are not limited to: flags presented at a building dedication for which the Member secured official funding, a flag presented to the family of a fallen soldier, flags presented for exceptional public distinction, etc,).”\n\nSo nothing in the handbook, either, limits members’ gifting of flags flown over the Capitol only to military families.\n\nIn December 2016, former Rep. Dennis Ross, a Republican from Florida, gave a folded, framed flag that had flown over the Capitol to a new school in Davenport, Florida. And the next year, Republican Rep. Roger Williams of Texas gifted two folded, encased flags from the Capitol to two new schools in his district.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

          "title": "Azar, Trump Mislead on FDA’s Hydroxychloroquine Decision",
          "text": "In a meeting at the White House, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar left the misleading impression that the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to revoke its emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 “removes a potential barrier” and makes it easier to access the drugs. The FDA’s action does the opposite.\n\nFollowing Azar’s lead, President Donald Trump also falsely accused a journalist of asking a “very inaccurately stated question” about the FDA’s emergency use authorization, or EUA, and continued to point to unscientific anecdotal evidence to insist that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, despite growing evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe FDA announced on June 15 that it had revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine because the drugs are “unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,” and that the “known and potential benefits” of the drugs “no longer outweigh” the risks — which can include “serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.”\n\nThe FDA had issued the EUA back in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile “when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.”\n\nBut accumulating evidence, including a large randomized controlled trial that the agency cited in its decision, has found that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Other trials also indicate that the drug does not prevent the disease if given shortly after exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nThe political spin began at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House when a journalist asked Trump to respond to news of the FDA’s revocation. The reporter paraphrased the agency as saying the drugs were “no longer considered reasonable as a useful treatment for COVID.”\n\nTrump has misleadingly promoted hydroxychloroquine as a potential “game changer,” despite its health risks and unproven use as a COVID-19 treatment.\n\nAzar said that the reporter’s question was not “quite accurate” because the FDA’s finding only applied to hospitalized patients. He then proceeded to suggest that revoking the EUA was a good thing because it removes a “significant misunderstanding” that the drug could only be used in a hospital setting.\n\nThe secretary stressed that the drug can still be prescribed for off-label use to treat COVID-19, saying the FDA’s decision “actually removes a potential barrier to that.”\n\nAzar, June 15: At this point, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are just like any other approved drug in the United States. They may be used in hospital, they may be used in out-patient, they may be used at home — all subject to a doctor’s prescription. In fact, the FDA’s removal of the emergency use authorization takes away what had been a significant misunderstanding by many that had made people think that somehow it could only be used in a hospital setting. And we’ve tried to make that clear throughout. It’s a drug. It’s approved in the United States. Has been for decades. If a doctor wishes to prescribe it, working with a patient, they may prescribe it for any purpose that they wish to do so. And this actually removes a potential barrier to that. Trump: So it actually un-complicates it — Azar: It does. Trump: — in a way. And I think that’s probably — your question was a very inaccurately stated question. Reporter: No, I didn’t mean to — I didn’t mean to pose it inaccurately. I believe what it said specifically was that it’s no longer reasonable to consider it an appropriate treatment. Azar: Only in the hospital. It said the data in the hospital setting was not supported. We continue to study in outpatient settings, as well as preventive. That data is not yet in.\n\nWhile it’s true that the FDA’s decision only pertains to hospitalized patients, the reporter’s phrasing is very similar to that used in the agency’s own revocation letter.\n\n“FDA has concluded that, based on this new information and other information discussed in the attached memorandum, it is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,” wrote FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton.\n\nRachel Sachs, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor, told us in a phone interview that the “reasonable” language, which both the reporter and the FDA used, is part of the statute governing how the FDA can issue EUAs.\n\n“One of the things that the FDA has to find when it grants an EUA is that it’s reasonable to believe that the drug in question is effective for the treatment of the condition,” she said. “And so what the FDA is saying now is that based on the weight of the evidence, it’s no longer reasonable to believe that hydroxychloroquine is effective for the treatment of COVID.”\n\nIn the letter, the agency toggles between statements that are specific to hospitalized patients and others that are more general. For instance, the FDA says that upon a second review of the in vitro studies that first suggested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have an ability to combat the coronavirus, it now believes the suggested doses “are unlikely to produce an antiviral effect.”\n\nIt also notes that the earlier studies that found the drugs might decrease the amount of virus patients shed “have not been consistently replicated,” and that a randomized controlled trial that more rigorously tested the idea found no difference between the proportion of those taking hydroxychloroquine and those getting the standard of care in testing negative for the virus.\n\nThat’s in addition to national guidelines that now do not recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside of a clinical trial, including the National Institutes of Health guidelines, which recommend against the use of the drugs outside of a trial.\n\nSeveral experts expressed bafflement that Azar — and then Trump — would object to the reporter’s question.\n\n“That’s exactly what the FDA said,” said Dr. Neil Schluger, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Columbia University who has studied hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. “Azar’s being very misleading in that statement.”\n\n“I thought the reporter’s question was perfect,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania with expertise in FDA regulation. “If Azar was doing his job as a public health official, he wouldn’t have chided the reporter for how he asked the question.”\n\nFDA Decision Doesn’t Remove ‘Potential Barrier’\n\nPerhaps more critically, experts balked at Azar’s suggestion that removing the EUA was lifting a “potential barrier” on hydroxychloroquine’s use, when in fact, the move reduces access to the drug by eliminating the option of getting it from the national stockpile.\n\n“He’s somehow implying that the EUA made people think you could only use this to treat COVID-19 for hospitalized patients, and now that they’ve removed the EUA, you could use it to treat COVID patients anywhere,” Schluger said of hydroxychloroquine in a phone interview. “It’s exactly the opposite of that.”\n\nAzar is correct to say that because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are FDA-approved to treat other conditions, including malaria — and in the case of hydroxychloroquine, rheumatoid diseases — they can be prescribed to COVID-19 patients in what’s called off-label prescribing.\n\nBut that has always been true. The EUA never changed that, and the revocation also does not change that.\n\n“The EUA had no impact on whether physicians could prescribe the drug off-label, whether patients could receive it off-label,” said Sachs. “It just made it easier for hospital-based providers to obtain the drug from the stockpile and to administer it to their patients.”\n\nIt’s useful to consider exactly what the initial EUA did in the first place. As Fernandez Lynch explained, the goal was to provide a supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile, based on the limited evidence at the time that the drugs might work against the coronavirus.\n\nWhile chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that can be prescribed off-label, the specific chloroquine tablets donated to the stockpile were not actually FDA-approved for any use. On top of that, interstate commerce laws prevent distribution of drugs for unapproved uses, which meant that both drugs could not be legally dispensed from the national stockpile for COVID-19.\n\nTo make that distribution legal, the FDA needed to issue an EUA, which the agency decided to limit to hospitalized patients outside of clinical trials.\n\nAzar’s argument appears to be that that specification confused people, leading some to think that the drug more broadly could only be prescribed to hospitalized patients — and that by revoking the entire EUA, that restriction was lifted.\n\nBut Sachs said that line of thinking doesn’t hold water.\n\n“I certainly have no evidence to support the claim that people believed hydroxychloroquine was only available in the hospital setting, and that now a barrier to its use was removed,” she said. “Sec. Azar’s framing sounds like what the FDA is doing is opening up hydroxychloroquine for broader use. But that’s actually not what’s going on — they’re actually restricting one avenue for its use by withdrawing the EUA.”\n\nFernandez Lynch agreed, saying it was misleading for Azar to characterize the EUA revocation as a kind of easing on hydroxychloroquine.\n\n“What they did was take away the EUA because the evidence no longer supported the EUA,” she said in a phone interview, adding that it was irresponsible as a public health official not to relay the information that led the FDA to change its mind. “Instead he went ahead and emphasized, do whatever you want under off-label prescribing — we’re going to leave this up to you.”\n\nContrary to Azar’s suggestion that the FDA was making it easier to get chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outpatients, the agency already came forward in late April to caution against the use of both drugs outside of hospitals or a clinical trial.\n\nMisleading Research Summaries\n\nDuring the roundtable, Azar and Trump also gave misleading or incomplete descriptions of the evidence to date about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19.\n\nAs he has done in the past, the president — who has claimed to have taken hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 — said he has heard “some great reports” about the drugs and suggested without evidence that the hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine were going to die anyway.\n\nTrump, June 15: The only place we don’t get necessarily reports are coming out of Alex’s agency or wherever they come from. I don’t understand that, Alex. What is it exactly? Because I have heard — I’ve had so many people that were so thrilled with the results from hydroxy. So, what is that exactly? Azar: Well, at your direction, we continue to study, especially in earlier phase — so a lot of the data that has come out that was more negative was people who were quite ill in the hospital. Trump: People that were, like, seriously ill. Like, they weren’t going to make it. “Let’s give them a little hydroxy.” And then they don’t make it. And they say, “Oh, wow, maybe the president was wrong.” All I know is that we’ve had some tremendous reports. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that they think it saved their lives.\n\nAs Schluger previously told us, the majority of patients in several hydroxychloroquine studies survived, so it’s not the case that hydroxychloroquine has only been given to deathly ill patients.\n\nIt is true, however, that nearly all of the studies have been done in hospitalized patients.\n\nThis includes a large randomized controlled trial in the U.K. called RECOVERY that the FDA cited in its EUA revocation decision. Although the full results have not been published, the trial reported on June 5 that hydroxychloroquine did not reduce the risk of death and also did not shorten the hospital stay or offer beneficial effects on other outcomes.\n\nAccording to a June 5 press release, 25.7% of the 1,542 hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine died after 28 days, whereas 23.5% of the 3,132 patients who were given usual care died — a difference that was not statistically significant.\n\nThe press release concluded that the results “convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.”\n\nFrom that data, plus other smaller randomized controlled trials and other rigorously performed observational studies, which we have previously reviewed, it does not appear hydroxychloroquine offers any benefit to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\n“The science is pretty straightforward on this,” said Schluger. “The data tell a pretty consistent story.”\n\nOn June 17, the World Health Organization announced that given the initial findings from its own trial, the results of the RECOVERY trial and a review of the evidence, it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity trial, which also was evaluating the drug in hospitalized patients.\n\nWhat is less clear — and where Trump and Azar may have a point — is that these results don’t necessarily rule out that hydroxychloroquine might still have some effect in milder cases or for COVID-19 prevention.\n\nSome scientists do think it’s plausible that hydroxychloroquine could still work in these instances — even if there isn’t yet any evidence that it does.\n\nAs Nicholas White, a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health and Mahidol University in Thailand, told us in an email, it’s “[m]uch easier to prevent infections growing in the body” than to get “rid of them once they have grown.”\n\nHe is helping to run a multinational randomized controlled trial with upwards of 40,000 participants to test whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine can prevent COVID-19 — and is concerned that some governmental decisions, including the FDA’s memo, might make it harder to complete the trials that are necessary to definitively say whether the drugs work or not.\n\nThe WHO, notably, also cautioned that its suspension decision should not apply to trials testing hydroxychloroquine’s ability to prevent COVID-19 either before or after exposure, or what is called pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nStill, Azar didn’t give the whole story when he said that the “data is not yet in” regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat people outside of the hospital or for COVID-19 prevention. While many of these trials are in the works, at least one has reported results — and it, too, failed to identify an effect.\n\nThe University of Minnesota published the first post-exposure prophylaxis randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3. In the double-blind trial, more than 800 volunteers were randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine or a placebo within four days of exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly 12% of hydroxychloroquine participants developed a COVID-19-like illness compared with 14.3% of those getting the placebo — a difference that was not significant.\n\nSome scientists argue that more data is needed. They have critiqued the study because it did not confirm COVID-19 infection in the vast majority of people who were exposed and went on to develop the disease — an unavoidable problem, given the lack of testing availability at the time. Others, meanwhile, have found the results largely convincing.\n\nSchluger called it a “pretty good study,” adding, “it’s a pretty big study — 821 patients — a randomized trial, so that’s a very high standard of evidence.”\n\nScience magazine reported on June 9 that another post-exposure prevention trial, run out of Barcelona, Spain, did not pick up a protective effect of hydroxychloroquine. The trial included more than 2,300 people who were exposed to the coronavirus and found there was no significant difference among those who received hydroxychloroquine versus the standard care in developing COVID-19. The study’s lead investigator told Science that the results had been submitted for publication.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota infectious disease specialist Dr. David Boulware, who led the first published prophylaxis trial, said no studies have reported results yet for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Those studies typically involve high-risk health care workers and have been slower to enroll volunteers.\n\nBut he said the results of his university’s trial of hydroxychloroquine in outpatients had been reported to the FDA.\n\n“Investigators from the University of Minnesota conducted a nationwide randomized clinical trial testing hydroxychloroquine for early outpatient treatment of COVID-19,” he said in an email, adding that the drug was given within four days of the start of COVID-19 symptoms. “The trial’s final results were shared with FDA on June 11, 2020 as well as with NIH, and the manuscript is presently undergoing scientific peer-review.”\n\n“There are no positive data supporting hydroxychloroquine having a clinical benefit in humans with coronavirus,” said Boulware in response to Azar’s claim that a lot of the “more negative” data was in very ill hospitalized patients. “The FDA is fully aware of what data do exist for earlier phase treatment.”\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

          "text": "Political leanings: Republican/ Pro-President Trump\n\n2018 total spending: $36.4 million\n\nAmerica First Policies is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit devoted to promoting the agenda of President Donald Trump. According to its website, the group’s main goals are rebuilding infrastructure, creating a strong workforce, reforming trade agreements, cutting taxes and updating regulations to support the Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n\nAmerica First Policies is allied with America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC that spent $36.4 million in the 2018 cycle.\n\nSix of Trump’s former campaign aides created America First Policies in January 2017. The group’s founders include: Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager; David Bossie, Trump’s 2016 deputy campaign manager; Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence’s former chief of staff; Marty Obst, who managed Pence’s gubernatorial campaign in Indiana; and Katrina Pierson, a 2020 campaign adviser for Trump.\n\nRick Gates, Trump’s other deputy campaign manager in 2016, also helped create the nonprofit. However, Gates was forced to leave the group in March 2017 because of his ties to Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman and chief strategist. As we have previously reported, both Manafort and Gates were indicted on charges of money laundering and tax evasion related to their work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.\n\nGates pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements to federal investigators. Manafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison after being found guilty in August 2018 on five tax fraud charges, one charge of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud.\n\nThe America First Action super PAC affiliated with America First Policies is led by Linda McMahon, who previously served in Trump’s cabinet as administrator of the Small Business Administration, and Brian O. Walsh, who, prior to joining America First Action, served as the president of the conservative outside groups American Action Network and the Congressional Leadership Fund.\n\nAmerica First Action raised $29 million in the 2018 election cycle and spent $29.3 million on independent expenditures, which are disbursements on communications advocating for or against particular candidates. Most of that, about $28 million, was spent trying to get Republicans elected to Congress. The organization spent more than $3 million opposing Democrat Colin Allred, who beat Republican Pete Sessions in Texas’ 32nd Congressional District and more than $2.8 million opposing Democrat Joe Donnelly, who lost to Mike Braun in Indiana’s Senate race. The group also spent more than $289,000 in support of Arizona Republican Martha McSally, who lost her Senate race to Democrat Krysten Sinema.\n\nSo far in 2020, the America First Action super PAC has raised more than $40 million. As of June 18, America First Action has spent more than $14.5 million in independent expenditures against presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden and $45,000 in support of Trump.\n\nAmerica First Policies has not publicly disclosed its donors to the Federal Election Commission because 501(c)(4) organizations are not required to do so."

          "title": "Trump Wrong on Obama-Biden Actions on Policing",
          "text": "In signing an executive order on policing issues, President Donald Trump falsely claimed former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden “never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period.”\n\nIn fact, the Obama administration took several steps to address police violence and community trust issues, some of which the Trump administration has dialed back.\n\nIn his June 16 remarks, Trump took a further swipe at Obama and Biden, his Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, adding, “The reason they didn’t try is because they had no idea how to do it.” The Trump administration clearly disagreed with some of the Obama administration measures. But it’s simply wrong for Trump to claim the prior administration didn’t do anything.\n\nThe Biden campaign disputed the claim. Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement that Trump “knows that isn’t true because he has spent the past three years tearing down the very reforms the Obama-Biden Administration pursued.” Bedingfield pointed to three initiatives:\n\nThe Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which issued recommendations for police departments in a May 2015 report.\n\nThe use of consent decrees to get police departments to enact changes regarding constitutional rights violations.\n\nLimits on the transfer of military weapons to police departments.\n\nDavid Alan Sklansky, professor of law and faculty co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, told us those are exactly the three initiatives he would cite. “All three of those were significant steps taken to address problems with American policing including but not limited to the use of force and the issue of race in policing,” he said.\n\nSklansky called Trump’s claim “baseless” and “flat-out false.”\n\n“It’s indisputable that the Obama administration did far more to address this issue than the Trump administration,” he said, adding that the Trump administration has tried to undo the progress the previous administration had made.\n\nSpecifically, the Trump administration limited the use of consent decrees and rolled back Obama’s restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to local police departments.\n\nLauren-Brooke Eisen and Spencer P. Boyer, of the Brennan Center for Justice, also cited these three measures in a June 16 post titled “What the Federal Government Can Do to Help Fix Policing in America.” They included one more Obama-era effort: the Collaborative Reform Initiative in the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, which worked with local law enforcement to evaluate their operations, and recommend and institute changes. That program, too, ended under Trump.\n\nTask Force on 21st Century Policing\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2014, Obama signed an executive order to create the Task Force on 21st Century Policing “to strengthen community policing and strengthen trust among law enforcement officers and the communities they serve,” a White House fact sheet said.\n\nThe task force was formed after several violent police incidents involving African Americans, including the 2014 killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York and Tamir Rice in Cleveland. It was chaired by Charles Ramsey, then the commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department and president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and Laurie Robinson, a professor of criminology and law at George Mason University and a former Justice Department official.\n\nIn November and December 2014, grand juries decided not to indict the officers in the Brown and Garner cases. In discussing the task force at the time, Obama said Ferguson, where weeks of protests occurred, exposed “a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color.”\n\nThe task force issued its final report in May 2015, offering recommendations on issues including building trust, community policing, officer training and officer safety. Sklansky told us the task force was “a very extensive operation that culminated in a very detailed, very thoughtful report with a lot of specific recommendations, many of which had to do with police violence.”\n\nRobinson, in a February article published in the ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, said the report “had an impact.” Several law enforcement groups “have embraced the report,” she said, and a think tank researcher said agencies across the country were using it “as their playbook.”\n\nThe Brennan Center experts noted that “not nearly enough jurisdictions have heeded the advice” in that report.\n\nBut it’s worth noting, as the Washington Post Fact Checker also did, that Trump’s executive order reflected the task force recommendations on a few points.\n\nTrump’s executive order called for the attorney general and secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to “develop opportunities to train law enforcement officers with respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental health, homelessness, and addiction” and “to increase the capacity of social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies.” The 2015 task force report recommended “multidisciplinary, community team approaches” for “responding to mental health crisis situations” as well as community problems involving “homelessness, substance abuse, domestic violence, human trafficking, and child abuse.”\n\nThe task force said law enforcement “policies for training on use of force should emphasize de-escalation and alternatives to arrest or summons in situations where appropriate,” while Trump’s executive order said the administration shall propose legislation that would include “training and technical assistance required to adopt and implement improved use-of-force policies and procedures, including scenario-driven de-escalation techniques.”\n\nConsent Decrees\n\nThe Obama administration’s Department of Justice Civil Rights Division conducted “pattern or practice” investigations of police departments focused on whether there were patterns of constitutional rights violations, and then obtained court-enforced consent decrees to get some departments to implement changes.\n\nA Jan. 5, 2017, exit memo by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the DOJ launched 23 such investigations under Obama and “is now enforcing 17 agreements with law enforcement agencies across the country, including 14 consent decrees.” Those investigations focused on the Ferguson Police Department, as well as agencies in Baltimore, Chicago and other cities.\n\n“Consent decrees were a very important initiative to try to bring systemic change to police departments,” addressing all forms of policing including use of force, Sklansky said. The Obama administration “launched more of these investigations than any previous administration.”\n\nBut the Trump administration significantly scaled back that effort. Eisen and Boyer write that on the day he left office, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions “signed a memo detailing the narrow circumstances under which DOJ can enter into a consent decree. Since President Trump took office, the Justice Department has publicly announced only one pattern-or-practice investigation into a police department.”\n\nThe Nov. 7, 2018, memo said it “provides guidance on the limited circumstances in which such a consent decree may be appropriate; limits the terms for consent decrees and settlement agreements with state and local governmental entities” and “amends the process for the approval of these mechanisms in cases in which they are permissible.”\n\nSessions had criticized the Baltimore consent decree, an agreement reached near the end of the Obama administration but signed by a federal judge in April 2017. Sessions said he had “grave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city.”\n\nMilitary Weapons\n\nObama also signed an executive order to create a working group to limit surplus military equipment and supplies that are provided for free to state and local law enforcement agencies under what’s called the 1033 program.\n\nThe administration then adopted the recommendations of the working group, issued in May 2015, creating a “prohibited equipment list” — which included tracked armored vehicles, grenade launchers and firearms/ammunition of .50 caliber and above — and a “controlled equipment list” — including wheeled armored vehicles, riot shields and helmets, and explosives. Police departments could still obtain the equipment in the latter group, but they would have to provide justification for needing it and proper training.\n\nWe wrote about this issue in 2017 when Sessions misleadingly cited studies to claim Obama “went too far” and undermined public safety.\n\nOn Aug. 28, 2017, Trump issued an executive order rescinding Obama’s.\n\nOther Efforts\n\nIn addition, the Brennan Center experts wrote about the Trump administration’s curtailing of the Collaborative Reform Initiative in the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, saying the program “had widespread support from police chiefs across the country” and allowed the DOJ to work with the cities and avoid litigation.\n\nSessions scaled back that program in September 2017, saying in a memo, “This is a course correction to ensure that resources go to agencies that require assistance rather than expensive wide-ranging investigative assessments that go beyond the scope of technical assistance and support.”\n\nAt the time, the Washington Post reported that Sessions’ decision would affect “about 14 police departments nationwide that had either begun receiving public reports from the COPS office or expected to receive such reports soon.”\n\nIn September 2015, the Obama DOJ also announced $23.2 million in grants to 73 local law enforcement agencies to “expand the use of body-worn cameras and explore their impact.”\n\nIn her exit memo, Lynch also touted implicit bias training that the DOJ required of all employees and federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nClearly, Trump was wrong to claim Obama and Biden “never even tried to fix” issues surrounding police brutality and lack of trust between police departments and the communities they serve. Trump may not agree with some of the measures — as evidenced by his eliminating or restricting them — but they were indeed efforts aimed directly at these issues.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

          "text": "Quick Take\n\nA Facebook post is spreading the false claim that former President Barack Obama gave $3.8 million to a lab in Wuhan, China. The money referenced was actually provided to a U.S. research group. Only $600,000 went to the lab as part of a U.S.-approved collaboration.\n\nFull Story\n\nA post circulating on Facebook is spreading a debunked falsehood about U.S. funding that went to a lab in Wuhan, China — the city where the outbreak of the novel coronavirus began — as well as a false claim about the origins of the virus.\n\n“President Trump just announced that the ‘biological’ lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created was ‘funded’ by President Barak Hussein Obama in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars,” the post reads. It further claims, falsely, that “this fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!”\n\nThe post, a text image, was uploaded as early as April but is continuing to spread.\n\nFirst of all, the suggestion that the virus was “created” is a baseless conspiracy theory that we first wrote about in February. We’ve continued to debunk similar claims.\n\nThe post’s main claim about U.S. funding is one that we’ve also previously addressed.\n\nThe $3.8 million figure refers actually to a $3.4 million grant that the National Institutes of Health awarded to a U.S.-based group, EcoHealth Alliance. That group was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats and first received the grant in 2014.\n\nOf that amount, EcoHealth gave $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology — a collaborator on the project that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department — Robert Kessler, EcoHealth’s spokesperson, previously told us.\n\nThe grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, Kessler said — and EcoHealth received $292,161 that year (part of the total $3.4 million it received). NIH terminated the grant in April.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also previously floated an unsupported claim that the amount received by the Wuhan lab was even higher — $7.5 million — and that he “ended it.” But as we explained before, the grant that was discontinued was EcoHealth’s and the portion that went to the lab was $600,000.\n\nA Fox News story in April also made reference to another $3.4 million NIH grant — regarding a behavioral study — and suggested that some of the funding may have gone to the Wuhan lab. (The story noted, however, that it was “not clear exactly how much U.S. funding went directly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it worked in collaboration with other institutions on the projects funded by the American grants.”)\n\nBut the recipient of that other grant, which was renewed this year — Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York — told us that wasn’t the case.\n\n“[B]ased on CSHL’s records for its NIH R01 award MH101214, there is nothing to indicate that any money from this grant was provided to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Dagnia Zeidlickis, the lab’s vice president of communications, told us in an email.\n\n\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

          "title": "Pence’s False Claims About Trump’s Handling of Coronavirus",
          "text": "During a visit to Iowa, Vice President Mike Pence made several false claims about President Donald Trump’s handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn remarks to employees of Winnebago Industries in Forest City, Iowa, June 16, Pence said Trump “shut down all travel from China.” The president did impose travel restrictions on China but did not shut down all travel.\n\nPence also said that Trump took the action before there had been a single case of the disease in this country. That also is not accurate.\n\nAnd finally, Pence said that Trump’s action gave the United States time to set up its response to the pandemic. But some disease experts say the Trump administration did not use that time effectively.\n\nPence, June 16: You know, before we had a single coronavirus case in this country, this president shut down all travel from China. It bought us invaluable time to stand up our national response.\n\nThere have been more than 2.1 million cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in the United States and more than 116,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, China, late last year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the China travel restrictions on Jan. 31. The restrictions, which went into effect Feb. 2, prohibited non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S.\n\nBut the new rules didn’t apply to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members.\n\nA New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect. So travel from China had hardly been “shut down.”\n\nTrump, too, has frequently overstated the extent of his travel restrictions. For example, as we have written, in April he three times incorrectly referred to a “travel ban” and on another occasion said he had “closed the border” with China.\n\nPence also was off-base in saying the travel restrictions were imposed before the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the United States. In fact, the first reported case was confirmed 11 days earlier, on Jan. 20. The infected man, a resident of Snohomish County, Washington, in his 30s, developed symptoms after returning from a trip to the area around Wuhan.\n\nThere were four confirmed cases as of Jan. 31, when the travel restrictions were announced, and nine cases two days later, when they took effect, according to the CDC.\n\nTrump has said accurately that no one had died in the U.S. when his administration announced the travel restrictions. The first reported coronavirus death in this country was disclosed on Feb. 29.\n\nPence said the travel restrictions “bought us invaluable time to stand up our national response.” But experts have faulted Trump for failing to use that time to act more aggressively in dealing with the pandemic. In fact, between Jan. 22 and March 10, Trump frequently minimized the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nFor example, Trump said on Feb. 26, “And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”\n\nAnd as late as March 10, the president said, “And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.” The following day, the World Health Organization declared the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.\n\nAsked whether the restrictions had indeed “bought us invaluable time,” Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email: “I do think it bought us a bit of time, though it was not very well or effectively implemented. The White House was in denial for January and most of February, and then took a laissez-faire attitude for much of March, squandering that time.”\n\nOne of the keys to dealing with a pandemic is widespread testing. In an ad in May, the Trump campaign misleadingly boasted that the president had taken “fast action” in regard to testing. But several infectious disease experts also disputed that assertion.\n\n“The United States has lagged nearly every developed country in ramping up testing, and the slow action is one reason why we have the worst epidemic in the world and are discussing reopening when it is not safe to do so, while other countries have used testing as a centerpiece of their strategy to reduce cases to a point where reopening is much more appropriate,” Lipsitch, told us for a previous story. “The lack of testing has been not only a public health catastrophe in the US, but also is a direct cause of our economic suffering.”\n\nAnd Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in an email at the time: “We need only look at other countries (like South Korea, Germany, Singapore, New Zealand and others) to see what rapid testing and identification can do to slow down spread of this virus. South Korea had done 150,000 tests before we had done 500. The fact that we have more deaths per million in the population than many other developed countries is a testament to our slow response to this virus.”\n\nAmong the factors slowing down the testing were the CDC’s problems in producing tests and delays in enlisting hospital labs and commercial labs in developing tests, according to Tom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration. In April, we documented the extent and causes of the testing delays.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you.

          "title": "Biden on Economic Growth and Trump’s Tax Cuts",
          "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden wrongly says “most of the conservative think tanks,” including the Heritage Foundation, agree that the tax cuts championed by President Donald Trump “generated virtually no growth at all.”\n\nThere are many economists who might agree with Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, that the tax cuts have not generated much, if any, economic growth, but most conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation, are not among them.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by Congress and signed by Trump in December 2017, was billed by Republicans as a catalyst to accelerate economic growth and in turn, to create more jobs and higher wages. The law lowered many individual tax rates, nearly doubled the standard deduction, eliminated personal exemptions and increased child tax credits, among other changes. It also cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It is expected to add $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.\n\nIn an open letter to Congress in November 2017, more than 100 economists in support of the tax cuts predicted the tax cuts would “ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations.”\n\nA Congressional Research Service review of the first-year impact of the law, however, did not find evidence of “large effects particularly in the short run.”\n\nCRS, May 22, 2019: In 2018, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 2.9%, about the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO’s) projected rate published in 2017 before the tax cut. On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy. Although growth rates cannot indicate the tax cut’s effects on GDP, they tend to rule out very large effects particularly in the short run. Although investment grew significantly, the growth patterns for different types of assets do not appear to be consistent with the direction and size of the supply-side incentive effects one would expect from the tax changes. This potential outcome may raise questions about how much longer-run growth will result from the tax revision.\n\nLast week, Biden seized on the GDP growth figures highlighted in the CRS report to argue that the TCJA has “generated virtually no growth at all.” And, Biden added, that is according to conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation.\n\n“Imagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut and we hadn’t wasted it on the wealthy, that generated virtually no growth at all,” Biden said on “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” on June 10. “No growth at all, according to most of the conservative think tanks.”\n\n“And imagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut that he promoted and got passed for the wealthy, even places like the Heritage Foundation said that didn’t grow the economy. $2 trillion,” Biden said on June 11 during a roundtable meeting in Philadelphia on opening the economy. “Imagine if we had it right now, to focus on the things that can build a new economy, invest in everything from teleconference, into providing for the kind of health.”\n\nWhat Economists Say\n\nWe reached out to the Biden campaign for backup, and it passed along the nonpartisan CRS report, which as we said, concluded that “the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy.”\n\nBiden’s campaign also pointed to a May 29, 2019, article from Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, who wrote that the CRS report findings were consistent with the Tax Policy Center prediction in December 2017 that the “short-term macroeconomic effects” would be “extremely modest.”\n\n“In fairness, the tax cuts didn’t occur in a vacuum,” Gleckman wrote in that same article. “Some of their benefits may have been offset by President Trump’s own highly restrictive trade policy, or magnified by new deficit spending approved by Congress in 2018.”\n\nIn his latest update about the economic impact of the TCJA, published on Feb. 5, Gleckman concluded after looking at two years of data: “Despite the Trump Administration’s rosy promises that the post-TCJA economy would boom, it has instead grown on many dimensions at roughly the same steady, unspectacular pace as it did prior to passage of the tax law.”\n\n“Our forecast at the time the TCJA became law was for a modest short-term bump in economic output (mostly from people spending their tax cuts) followed by a gradual return to pre-TCJA trend,” Gleckman told us via email. “That is pretty much what happened. … Business investment fell after passage. Employment pretty much tracked pre-TCJA trends. GDP growth had its bump, then returned to trend.”\n\n“Remember too that the growth story the White House told was this: The TCJA would encourage more capital investment that would lead to more productivity and, eventually, to higher wages,” Gleckman said. “The reality was: We never even got the first step, except for a brief period just before and after passage of the law.”\n\nGleckman acknowledged, however, that it is “impossible to pull apart tax policy from other issues, including Trump’s trade policy in 2018 and 2019.” It is possible, he said, that the “TCJA contributed to more growth but that benefit was offset by the tariffs (which are a tax increase on US consumers and businesses). Or not.”\n\n“The disruptions of 2020 mean we never will know the long-term effects of the TCJA,” Gleckman said. “But based on what we saw in 2018 and 2019, there is no evidence that the TCJA contributed very much to economic growth.”\n\nThose analyses — from CRS and the Tax Policy Center, which is not a conservative group — provide some ammunition for Biden’s claim that the TCJA “generated virtually no growth at all.” That’s his assessment, and some economists agree.\n\nBut Biden is wrong to claim that “most of the conservative think tanks” agree.\n\nBiden’s campaign cited three articles that it says came from conservative institutions: two from the American Enterprise Institute and one from the Tax Foundation. None of them support Biden’s claim, though.\n\nThe article from Nicole Kaeding, then at the Tax Foundation, was titled “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act After A Year” and was published on Dec. 17, 2018.\n\nKaeding wrote that one year after the law’s passage there was “very little” evidence “we point to on how the Act has impacted the U.S economy.” But Kaeding also wrote that “the law’s design is such that the economic impacts are long-run. It takes several years for the lower cost of capital to impact investment. Firms need time to plan, purchase, and permit new investments before they put the items into service. As we noted in our original score, much of the acceleration of growth happens several years after the law’s original passage, before fading as provisions in the law expire.”\n\nGarrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said Biden is distorting the Tax Foundation’s position.\n\n“Our position is not that the TCJA ‘has generated no growth at all,’ but rather that identifying the specific impact the TCJA had on growth is challenging given the many other factors at play that drive business investment and economic growth,” Watson told us via email. “This includes the economic headwinds produced by the escalating trade war in 2019 and the coronavirus pandemic today. This is in addition to the fact that it may take several years to isolate the impact of a tax change, as Nicole pointed out in her piece. We provided feedback on a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report on TCJA last year, for example, arguing that ‘its conclusion that the TCJA has produced little to no increase in output (GDP) and its argument that investment has not increased as was expected…are too strong given the evidence.’”\n\nThe first article from the American Enterprise Institute cited by the Biden campaign was one written by Alan Viard, a resident scholar at AEI. Although Viard wrote that “a sharp uptick in investment has not occurred,” he did not conclude that the TCJA has generated no growth.\n\nRather, Viard posed three possibilities, only one of which considers the possibility that “the corporate tax cut is not boosting investment.” It is also possible, he wrote, that “the boost is taking longer than expected” or that “the tax cut boosted investment relative to what it would otherwise have been, even as other factors (perhaps other TCJA provisions or the trade war) have offset the boost.”\n\n“It would be very surprising it if didn’t generate any growth at all,” Viard told us in a phone interview, adding that as a general economic principle, the corporate tax cuts should increase investment in the U.S.\n\nViard said that while “the growth impact may be smaller than many of us [conservative economists] thought,” it is “impossible to know” whether the law’s effects are simply taking longer than expected, or if the growth it generated has been offset by other factors, such as the trade war.\n\nThe third article cited by the Biden campaign is a blog post written for AEI by Jason Furman. But Furman is not affiliated with AEI. Furman, an economics professor at Harvard and a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, served eight years as a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. According to Viard, Furman was simply invited to participate in a blog symposium about the effects of the TCJA. The symposium sought to include input from economists across the ideological spectrum.\n\nWrong on Heritage Foundation\n\nAs for Biden’s specific claim that “even places like the Heritage Foundation said that [TCJA] didn’t grow the economy,” the Biden campaign did not get back to us with backup for that.\n\nBut the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, says that’s false.\n\nOn Twitter, Adam Michel, a senior policy analyst who focuses on tax policy for the Heritage Foundation, pointed to his Dec. 12 commentary “How 2 Years of Tax Cuts Have Supported Our Strong Economy.”\n\nWhen Biden said something similar last August, Michel tweeted, “I think I’ve written something basically every week for the last year+ that says the tax cuts are working.”\n\nIn a series of tweets, Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of Heritage, also took issue with Biden’s comments, saying, “The country saw increased wage growth, business investment, and employment thanks to the law.”\n\nIn a Nov. 4 post, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation looked at what economists from various viewpoints were saying about the TCJA nearly two years after its implementation. One of its conclusions: “Economists do not agree on the economic effects of the TCJA.” Additionally, it concludes, “economists generally agree that while certain definitive trends are emerging, it is impossible to undertake a full accounting of the TCJA’s effects until more time has passed.”\n\n“A full analysis of the effects of the TCJA will not be possible to complete for years to come, if ever,” the Peterson report states.\n\nBiden is, of course, entitled to his opinion about the effect of the TCJA. And he has numerous economists he could cite who agree the tax cuts have, to date, resulted in very little economic growth. But he is wrong when he says that “most of the conservative think tanks” in general, and the Heritage Foundation in particular, agree that the tax cuts resulted in “virtually no growth.” In fact, they do not agree.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

          "text": "Quick Take\n\nA meme misrepresents a 2007 criminal case in Houston involving George Floyd. The meme distorts the details of Floyd’s case and includes a photo of a woman who was badly injured in an unrelated attack in Spain in 2018.\n\nFull Story\n\nA popular meme has misrepresented a criminal case involving George Floyd more than a decade ago.\n\nFloyd’s death in police custody on May 25 sparked nationwide protests against racism and police violence, which has made the incident a target for misinformation since then.\n\nNow a meme with a photo of a woman’s bruised and bloody face is circulating on social media with this claim: “Aracely Henriquez was the woman kidnapped and brutally beaten by George #Floyd and his five accomplices, as they searched her home for drugs and money. She was pregnant at the time, and he asked her if she wanted him to kill her baby.”\n\nBut the woman pictured is not Aracely Henriquez. The photo actually shows Andrea Sicignano, an American student who was raped and beaten in Madrid, Spain, in 2018.\n\nIn a June 12 post on Facebook, Sicignano wrote, “Today my photo is being used as political propaganda/click bait to make people believe that George Floyd deserved to die.” She asked that those who see her photo being used that way report it to Facebook and correct the person who shared it.\n\nThe photo, Sicignano explained in her recent post, was taken at the hospital after she was attacked. She posted it on Facebook shortly after the attack, and the picture was later published in a Spanish newspaper, which is likely where it was taken from for the meme.\n\nBeyond the use of the picture, the meme gets other parts of the claim wrong, too.\n\nHere’s what’s true about the case:\n\nFloyd pleaded guilty in 2009 to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. He was not charged with kidnapping or assault.\n\nAccording to the complaint in the case, filed in 2007, Floyd was one of six men who forced his way into the Houston home that Aracely Henriquez shared with Angel Negrete and a 1-year-old child.\n\nOne of the men claimed to be from the water department in order to get Henriquez to open the door. Then Floyd, who was described as the biggest of the men who pulled up in a black Ford Explorer, forced his way in and “placed a pistol against the complainant’s abdomen, and forced her into the living room,” the complaint says. It doesn’t say whether or not Henriquez was pregnant.\n\nFloyd then searched the house while another man guarded Henriquez. That man hit her in the “head and side areas” with his pistol after she “screamed for help,” the complaint says.\n\nSo, while Floyd did plead guilty to a charge stemming from the invasion of Henriquez’s home, the picture circulating with the claim doesn’t show Henriquez and the claim distorts the details of the case.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

          "text": "Quick Take\n\nA conspiracy theory on Facebook is falsely claiming that the killing of George Floyd was “filmed before covid19” because “[n]ot a single person is wearing a mask” in the videos. Some of the officers and officials in the videos can clearly be seen wearing masks.\n\nFull Story\n\nSince the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, conspiracy theories about his death have swirled online as posts have falsely suggested that the death was “staged” or that “crisis actors” were involved.\n\nNow, a repeatedly posted image on Facebook feeding into that narrative wrongly claims that the killing was “filmed before covid19” because “not a single person is wearing a mask” in the videos.\n\n“It just dawned on me the most glaring component of the Floyd psyop… it was filmed before covid19… How do I know… Not a single person is wearing a mask…” the post claims. It specifically asserts that Floyd and “the cops,” among others, were not wearing masks.\n\nBut the claim is undercut by a review of footage that is publicly available.\n\nTake the viral video that shows former Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck, for example. The video, captured by a bystander, shows that two EMTs who arrived at the scene, and who helped put Floyd into an ambulance, can be seen wearing surgical masks.\n\nChauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter and second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony.\n\nOther footage captured by surveillance cameras at a nearby restaurant also shows that former Officer Thomas Lane — one of three officers charged with aiding and abetting unintentional second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter — was also wearing a mask.\n\nAnother officer who was present at the scene can also be seen wearing a face covering, the surveillance video shows. More footage captures a firefighter, who arrived after the ambulance left, also wearing a mask.\n\nSo the assertion that “[n]ot a single person is wearing a mask” in the videos is false. The footage, in fact, undercuts the baseless theory that Floyd’s death was “filmed before covid19.”\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

          "text": "In the days leading up to President Donald Trump’s first campaign rally since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, Trump and his supporters are making false and misleading claims about COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and testing:\n\nIn a tweet, Trump claimed that the U.S. testing program “is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases.” Although the U.S. has completed the highest number of coronavirus tests, it still lags behind other nations in tests per capita, and a higher proportion of tests have also come back positive.\n\nNational Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow inaccurately said in a television interview that “hospitalizations may be going up, but that’s because elective procedures are now permitted.” COVID-19 hospitalization figures, which are increasing in some locales, are limited to those with COVID-19 diagnoses.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, Trump and Kudlow all suggested that the uptick in COVID-19 cases seen in some states is driven by increases in testing. Testing accounts for some of the rise, but doesn’t explain all of it.\n\nOklahoma, the site of Trump’s rally, has seen an increase in the number of people who are “currently hospitalized” with confirmed cases of COVID-19, state data shows. But GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma falsely said of his state: “We continue to see hospitalizations decline.”\n\nSimilarly, Pence wrongly said that COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma have “declined precipitously.” The state Health Department reports that “Oklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases,” reaching a new single-day high on June 16.\n\nTrump is set to speak at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 20.\n\nTrump’s Testing Tweet\n\nIn a June 15 tweet, Trump once again bragged about America’s ability to test for the coronavirus, leaving the misleading impression that better testing is responsible for the country’s large number of cases.\n\n“Our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases,” he said. “Without testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases.”\n\nLater in the day, Trump repeated the sentiment, saying in a roundtable at the White House, “If you don’t test, you don’t have any cases. If we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any.”\n\nTo some extent he’s right — if there were less testing, then the reported number of cases would be lower, although of course those infections would still exist.\n\nBut experts say Trump is wrong to claim that the U.S. is more advanced on testing “than any other country.”\n\n“The US may have done the most tests, but not the highest # of tests per capita. And our positivity is higher than many other countries,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said on Twitter in response to the president’s tweet.\n\n“In summary: we still haven’t done enough testing for the size of our epidemic, which is largest in world,” she added.\n\nAs we have explained before, the total number of tests completed is not necessarily reflective of how well a country is meeting the challenge of diagnosing its COVID-19 patients. Typically, a superior indicator is tests per capita, which takes into account a country’s population. And even better is the test positivity rate, or the proportion of tests that are positive, which can show how much testing has been done relative to the size of an outbreak.\n\nAs of June 14 — the latest data available when Trump made his claim — the U.S. had completed just over 23.5 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nThat is the largest number of total tests performed by a single country, per statistics collected by Our World in Data. But it is not the top per-capita rate. On that metric, 16 other nations best the U.S., including Iceland, Denmark, Russia, Italy and Australia.\n\nAnd with nearly 9% of all tests having come back positive, the U.S. is not even close to being in the vanguard for low test positivity: The U.S. ranks behind at least 50 other nations.\n\nAs we’ve mentioned before, there are limitations with the figures compiled by Our World in Data, since different countries report their testing statistics differently. So the numbers may not be directly comparable, but they are widely viewed as the best available international data on the subject.\n\nA Johns Hopkins website that uses slightly different calculations based on daily averages — which Nuzzo told us was done because different countries are in different stages of their pandemics — also shows the U.S. lagging behind numerous other countries on per-capita tests, test positivity or both.\n\nThe website notes that countries’ testing programs “should be scaled to the size of their epidemic, not the size of the population” and says the positivity rate “is the most reliable way to determine if a government is testing enough.”\n\nThe World Health Organization suggested on May 12 that nations achieve a 5% or lower test positivity rate for at least two weeks before considering loosening public health measures.\n\nThe cumulative test positivity rate in the U.S. has yet to go that low, although the U.S. is close to reaching that two-week benchmark, as data from the COVID Tracking Project demonstrates.\n\nThe national number, however, still obscures vast differences in locations across the country. A Johns Hopkins data visualization shows that as of June 16, 34 states plus Washington, D.C., have had 5% or fewer tests come back positive, as averaged over the past seven days, while 16 states and Puerto Rico are still above that level.\n\nKudlow’s False Hospitalization Claim\n\nIn an interview on CNN about COVID-19, Kudlow inaccurately attributed rising hospitalization numbers in some parts of the country to elective procedures. Those figures are specific to people diagnosed with COVID-19, and therefore are unaffected by elective procedures.\n\nKudlow also suggested that increased testing was responsible for the uptick in cases. But more testing only partially explains the trends.\n\nKudlow made his remarks in a June 14 interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Jake Tapper.\n\nHe first acknowledged that some places in the U.S. have recently seen a rise in the number of COVID-19 infections.\n\n“We have had an increase in cases in some states. I don’t want to hide that. That’s a fact,” he said. “I think Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina and Florida. There have been some small metropolitan areas that have had an increase.”\n\nBut then he pointed out that testing has increased, and said that hospitalizations were up because of elective procedures now being allowed.\n\n“Now, remember, Jake, we are now testing at about a hundred times the rate we were back in March, when the pandemic first exploded,” Kudlow said. “[H]ospitalizations may be going up,” he added, “but that’s because elective procedures are now permitted. And maybe, most importantly, Jake, although the case rate has increased a bit, we’re not talking about a second round here.”\n\nBut hospitalizations are not up in some areas because of elective procedures. “States should be tracking COVID-related hospitalizations,” said Johns Hopkins’ Nuzzo in an email to FactCheck.org, “not all hospitalizations.”\n\nAnd indeed, they are, although not all states report hospitalizations or document them over time. Texas posted a record-high of 2,287 “COVID-19 hospitalizations” on the day Kudlow made his remarks — a tally that has since climbed to 2,518, according to the state dashboard.\n\nThe number is the sum of all “lab-confirmed” COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the state’s trauma service areas, which has risen nearly 40% since Memorial Day.\n\nState data in Arkansas also shows a surge since the end of May, with 214 “currently hospitalized COVID-19 patients” as of June 16 — approximately double the number two weeks ago.\n\nNorth Carolina, too, has seen a steady rise in the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations for the past month. The state notes that the figures reflect the “current hospitalizations due to COVID-19,” which are self-reported by hospitals.\n\nThere is another hospital metric — bed use rates, or hospital capacity — that could change as hospitals reopen and begin to do more surgeries. As Nuzzo said, “Bed availability is another element to track and that would be influenced by the resumption of elective procedures.”\n\nBut even if that is what Kudlow meant — and we asked the White House for clarification, but didn’t hear back — it isn’t what he said.\n\nUpticks in COVID-19 Cases Not Just Due to More Testing\n\nKudlow’s more fundamental claim, which Trump echoed and Pence also suggested, is that the increases some states are now seeing in their COVID-19 cases are because of expanded testing.\n\nThe New York Times reported on June 15 that Pence told governors in a private call to “make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,” and that in “most of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number, that’s more a result of the extraordinary work you’re doing.”\n\nIn the call, Pence also repeated Kudlow’s false claim that “because people are going back to hospitals and elective surgery and getting ordinary care, hospitalization rates may be going up.”\n\nAt a roundtable the same day, the vice president said, “We really believe that the vast majority of new cases is a reflection, as you said, of a dramatic increase in testing.”\n\nHe then gave the example of California, which he said had flat hospitalization and test positivity numbers. “And in those areas where — just a few states — where we’re seeing positive rates go up, we’ll be talking to governors today, in states like Georgia and Arizona and Texas, about deploying additional CDC personnel to help them identify where those outbreaks are occurring and how we can mitigate those efforts.”\n\n“With more than 22 million tests having been performed across the country, we — we continue to see overall that what’s called a positive test rate remains very stable in the country,” he continued. “As we said earlier, Mr. President, there is a few states where the positivity rate is climbing, and we’re working very closely with those governors to identify that.”\n\nPence is right that at least for now, the nation’s test positivity rate hasn’t gone up, and that California’s increased COVID-19 caseload is likely explained by bolstered testing.\n\nBut that’s not true everywhere — and it’s not just a “few” states that have reported growth in their test positivity rates.\n\n“It is true that the number of cases reflects not just how many cases there are in the community, but also testing capacity,” Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us during a press call. But, she added, “I think that the signals that we’re seeing from across the country are real, and they correspond to what we knew would happen when society started to open up, which is that we get more mixing, and we’ll start to see the emergence of the virus spreading again.”\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Wall Street Journal in a June 16 interview that while more testing leads to more cases, higher positivity rates in many states “cannot be explained by increased testing.”\n\n“Testing positivity is going UP in nearly half of US states, which is a sign that increasing case numbers is not just due to more testing,” noted Nuzzo in a tweet.\n\nTest positivity is an important metric because it should stay steady or decrease if increased testing is behind a higher number of identified cases. An increasing percentage of positive tests, as long as testing hasn’t dropped off, indicates a surge in infections.\n\nAccording to a Johns Hopkins data visualization that tracks the weekly change in states’ test positivity numbers, many of the states with increases in the percentage of positive tests are located in the South.\n\nCaitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, noted that testing could explain some — but not all — of the upticks.\n\n“Are increased case counts partially attributable to increased testing?” she asked in a tweet. “Probably in part. But in places where hospitalizations and the % of tests that come back positive is high or rising, those are sure signs of trouble.”\n\nIn a June 11 call with reporters, Dr. Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, also emphasized looking at the hospitalization figures to understand what is happening — a point he later iterated in a Twitter thread.\n\n“In Texas, if you look at the numbers in detail, you can see that hospitalization rate is going up. Similarly, in Arizona, ICU beds, hospitalization rates for COVID patients are going up. So those are real changes,” he said. “There are more sick people than there were a month ago, substantially more.”\n\nHe said California, though, did not have the same concerning trends. “In California, even though the number of daily cases is higher on a day-to-day basis than it was weeks ago, the overall hospitalization rate on their dashboard is stable,” he said. “So that would suggest perhaps there’s more testing going on in California and maybe they’re finding more mild and moderate cases, but they aren’t seeing a rise in the number of very sick people.”\n\n“Other states like Florida aren’t reporting hospitalization,” he added. “So you can’t really make any determinations without having access to that data.”\n\nMany public health experts suspect that reopening policies are behind the rise in some states, although Inglesby noted that not all states have experienced increases.\n\n“In some cases, some states that have reopened have not had sharp rises. I think as reopening goes forward, we’ll be able to know more,” he said. “But what we do know is that this virus transmits person to person, the more activity that’s allowed that is based on close personal interaction, the more opportunities there will be for transmission.”\n\nBuckee said it was too early to know what will happen for certain, but that the rising number of cases in some places will likely lead to more severe illnesses and deaths, even if it hasn’t shown up yet.\n\n“I think that there’s no question that we’re going to see a surge in hospitalizations and deaths in places like Arizona, due to that uptick in cases,” she said. “It’s just a matter of waiting for a few weeks.”\n\nCases that happen now, she said, will result in deaths in about three weeks.\n\nIn addition to the increase in cases, she said many of the states in the southeastern U.S. have worrying demographic factors as well, which put those populations at higher risk.\n\n“The concern is not just the policies and the reopening and spreading of the virus, but the significant risks of morbidity and mortality in those populations,” she said. “We know that African American communities are being hit particularly hard, diabetes is a risk factor, and so on. Those are all going to mean that we expect more illness and more death from COVID.”\n\nOklahoma’s ‘COVID-19 Current Hospitalizations,’ Cases Increase\n\nOn ABC’s “This Week,” Sen. Lankford of Oklahoma was asked whether the president should postpone his Tulsa rally due to health concerns.\n\n“I do not believe so, actually,” Lankford said. “We’ve gone through phase one, phase two, and phase three. We continue to see hospitalizations decline, deaths decline in Oklahoma.”\n\nThe senator is right about COVID-19 deaths, but not about hospitalizations.\n\nIn its most recent Weekly Epidemiology and Surveillance Report for the week of June 5 through June 11, the Oklahoma Department of Health said there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.\n\nOklahoma Department of Health, June 12: Oklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, though the number of deaths have remained approximately the same and the percentage of positives remains low at 3.7%. The increase in the number of cases is caused by both ongoing community transmission and outbreaks that affect specific populations. The threat of COVID still exists and we anticipate it to grow.\n\nFor the two-week reporting period, from June 1 to June 12, the number of “COVID-19 Cases Currently Hospitalized” increased from 69 to 86, according to separate Executive Order Reports that the state Health Department publishes every weekday.\n\nAs of June 15, there were 98 current hospitalizations — the highest since May 7, when there were 113 people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, which tracks hospitalization data for 42 states, including Oklahoma.\n\nPrior to Lankford’s appearance on “This Week,” the Executive Order Reports showed a one-day drop on June 11, from 97 to 86. But, until the June 11 drop, there were six straight days of more COVID-19 hospitalizations, the reports show.\n\nThe most recent weekly epidemiology report also said there were 719 confirmed cases for the week ending June 11, an increase of 12.9% from the previous week, while deaths had declined 11.6%.\n\nDespite the current uptick in COVID-19 hospitalizations, there are still far fewer than there were in mid-April, according to the Carlson School of Management’s hospitalization tracking website. The Sooner State recorded the highest number of hospitalizations on April 13, when 194 people were hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the university website.\n\n(Technical note: The state also issues “situation update” reports every weekday that provide “current hospitalizations,” which the state Health Department says represent “a combination of hospitalized positive cases and hospitalized persons under investigation.” The Carlson School’s website reports “only the confirmed cases of hospitalizations” when a state provides the data, as Oklahoma does, according to Pinar Karaca-Mandic, a professor of health care risk management and a project team leader. We, too, are using only confirmed cases for this story.)\n\nOklahoma has been slowly reopening its businesses since April 24, when it entered what Gov. Kevin Stitt called phase 1 of a three-phase plan. The state fully opened for business on June 1.\n\n“Under Phase 3, businesses may resume unrestricted staffing at their worksites by observing proper CDC-recommended social distancing protocols and are recommended to continue increased cleaning and disinfecting practices,” according to a press release issued by the governor’s office. “Individuals should minimize time spent in crowded environments and continue following CDC guidelines regarding social distancing.”\n\nDespite the state’s advice to “minimize time spent in crowded environments,” Trump said he expects to fill the BOK Center, which seats about 19,000, and is looking for a second location to increase capacity for the event.\n\n“We have a 22,000-seat arena, but I think we’re going to also take the convention hall next door, and that’s going to hold 40,000,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on June 15. “So we’ll have 22,000 plus 40,000. … [I]t’s an amazing — nobody has ever heard numbers like this. I think we’re going to have a — we’re going to have a great time.”\n\nAt the same Cabinet meeting, Pence expressed confidence about Oklahoma’s ability to host the rally, in part because COVID-19 cases in the state have “declined precipitously.”\n\nPence, June 15: The number of cases in Oklahoma — it’s declined precipitously, and we feel very confident going forward with the rally this coming weekend.\n\nThat’s false. As we stated earlier, the state reports that the number of COVID-19 cases is now on the rise in Oklahoma.\n\nIn its weekly epidemiology report for May 29 through June 4, the state Health Department said there had been “637 confirmed cases in the past week 8.0% increase from the week before (May 22-28).” A week later, the department said that from June 5 to June 11 there had been “719 confirmed cases in the past week 12.9% increase from the week before (May 29-June 4).”\n\nA day after Pence’s remarks, the state recorded a single-day high of 228 new cases on June 16, as well as four deaths.\n\nAs of June 11, at the time of the last weekly report, the state had 7,626 confirmed cases. As of June 16, Oklahoma had 8,645 confirmed cases — an increase of 1,019 cases, the daily state data shows.\n\nUpdate, June 18: The article was updated to include comments about testing from NIAID Director Anthony Fauci.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

The Reuters team covered the events by exposing, in scoop after scoop, Beijing’s intervention and perilous misreading of the mood in the free-wheeling financial center of Hong Kong.\n\n“Our photographers brilliantly captured the magnitude of the protests in Hong Kong,” said Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler. “The team was on the front lines of this monumental set of events, illustrating the stories of hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers, from what started off as peaceful marches and evolved into the city’s largest political crisis. Their images were beautiful, haunting, illuminating and deeply memorable. I am extremely proud of the team, along with our spectacular finalists, and thank every one of them for their courage, persistence, ingenuity and skill.”\n\n“I couldn’t be more proud of our fearless journalists. The protests in Hong Kong served as a defining moment of 2019 and across both of these nominations, covered the story from all angles and delivered trusted and reliable journalism to inform our customers and readers,” said Reuters President Michael Friedenberg."

          "text": "يتداول مستخدمو مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي وبعض المواقع الإخبارية خبرًا مفاده أنه قد تم إغلاق ملف كورونا رسميًّا،\n\nوذلك بعد تصريح منظمة الصحة العالمية بشكل نهائي -حسب زعمهم- أن الفيروس لا ينقل إلا عن طريق الأشخاص الذين يظهرون أعراض المرض وأهمّها الحرارة،\n\nوعلى ذلك تم تغيير السياسة المتّبعة إلى البحث عن هؤلاء الأشخاص فقط،\n\nولم يعد هنالك داع للحجر الصحي لغير المصابين،\n\nوأنه لا فائدة من إجراءات التباعد الاجتماعي والمسح الوطني،\n\nوسيتم توجيه أمر لكافة البلدان بالفتح، وأنّ ما حصل في الأشهر الثلاثة الماضية كان مجرّد سوء فهم،\n\nأرفق ناشرو الادعاء هذا الرابط كدليل على كلامهم:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid\n\nنشرت صفحة الفيسبوك المسماة Elnahar Tv Live الادعاء في 12/06/2020 بالصيغة الآتية:\n\nحقّق المقطع تفاعلًا كبيرًا، وأعيدت مشاركته 1100 مرة حتى تاريخ تحرير هذا المقال في 13/06/2020،\n\nنشر المقطع عدد من الصفحات الأخرى على ذات الموقع (هنا، هنا، هنا وهنا)، على غرار تويتر (هنا، هنا وهنا)،\n\nكما نشر الادعاء أيضًا عدد من المواقع الإخبارية الأخرى (هنا، هنا وهنا).\n\nبعد البحث والتدقيق في مدى صحة الادعاءات تبين ما يلي:\n\nهل صرّحت منظمة الصحة العالمية بشكل نهائي أن الفيروس لا ينتقل إلا عن طريق الأشخاص الذين تظهر عليهم أعراض المرض، وأهمها الحرارة؟\n\nلا لم تفعل،\n\nأقرب تصريح يقصده ناشرو الادعاء هو ذلك الذي صدر عن رئيسة وحدة الأمراض الناشئة والأمراض حيوانيّة المنشأ في منظمة الصحة العالمية، الدكتورة ماريا فان كيرخوف Maria Van Kerkhove،\n\nخلال مؤتمر صحفي (مكتوب هنا) عقدته المنظمة في 08/06/2020 في جواب لها عن سؤال لصحفية رويترز،\n\nعندما سألتها عن إمكانية انتقال المرض عن طريق الأشخاص الذين لم تظهر عليهم الأعراض، فأجابت جوابًا من جزئين،\n\nكان الجزء الثاني منه أنّ منظمة الصحة من خلال تواصلها مع بعض الدول الأعضاء وحصولها على معطيات غير منشورة بعد، ومعطيات أخرى منشورة،\n\nتحاول دراسة دور الأشخاص الحاملين للفيروس وغير المصابين بالأعراض في انتقال المرض،\n\nوأنّه من خلال هذه المعطيات يظهر أن مساهمة هؤلاء الأشخاص في نقل الفيروس نادر جدًّا؛\n\nأو كما قالت حرفيًّا:\n\nBut from the data we have it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic actually transmits onward to a secondary individual\n\nولكن من البيانات التي لدينا، لا يزال يبدو أنه من النّادر أن يقوم شخص غير مصاب بالأعراض بنقل الفيروس إلى شخص آخر.\n\nومنه، هي قالت إنه حتى الساعة فقط ولم تقل بشكل نهائي.\n\nرد الفعل تجاه هذا التصريح وبداية انتشار الادعاء:\n\nلاقى هذا التصريح انتقادًا كبيرًا من طرف العديد من السياسيين (هنا، هنا، وهنا) على رأسهم الرئيس البرازيلي (هنا)،\n\nإضافة إلى بعض المواقع الإخبارية العالمية (هنا)،\n\nلكن بعض هذه الانتقادات أخرجت تصريحات منظمة الصحة عن سياقها،\n\nما أدى إلى انتقادها بشدة، ليتم تعديلها لاحقا (هنا).\n\nتوضيحات منظمة الصحة العالمية:\n\nدفعت موجة الانتقادات التي تعرضت لها منظمة الصحة، إلى توضيح كلامها أولًا من خلال مجموعة من التغريدات للدكتورة ماريا فان كيرخوف (هنا)،\n\nأوضحت من خلال تغريدة من التغريدات أن الأشخاص الذين لا يعانون من أعراض يساهمون بدرجة أقل في نقل المرض من أولئك الذين تظهر عليهم أعراض المرض،\n\nودعمت كلامها قائلة إنّ ذلك موضح في الوثيقة التي نشرتها منظمة الصحة قبل المؤتمر بثلاث أيام (05/06/2020)،\n\nلتعود بعدها الدكتورة نفسها في مؤتمر صحفي آخر يوم 09/06/2020،\n\nوتوضح في بداية اللقاء أنها تريد توضيح كلامها الذي أسيء فهمه،\n\nقائلة أن ما قصدت بكلامها -وتحديدا عبارة “نادر جدا”- هو الدراسات الجديدة التي وصلتهم ولم يتم نشرها بعد،\n\nولم تكن تقصد بها جميع الأشخاص غير المصابين بالأعراض،\n\nولا أنّ سياسة المنظمة المتّبعة في المرحلة القادمة سيتم تغييرها.\n\nتقييم فتبينوا: زائف.\n\nماهي الوثيقة المرفقة بالادعاء إذن؟\n\nالوثيقة ليست لمنظمة الصحة العالمية كما يتم زعمه، فهي منشورة على الموقع الرسمي للحكومة البريطانية،\n\nفي الجزء الخاص بالأمراض المعدية العالية الخطورة (HCID)،\n\nإذ أنه –حسب الوثيقة– بعد توفّر معلومات أكثر حول المرض؛ تحديدا معدّل الوفيات المنخفض، وتوفّر فحوصات أكثر دقة التي يمكن استعمالها في المرحلة القادمة إضافة إلى وعي إكلينيكي أكبر،\n\nيجعل وباء كوفيد-19 لا ينتمي إلى الأمراض المعدية عالية الخطورة في بريطانيا بعد تاريخ 19/03/2020،\n\nوبالتالي تنتقل مسؤولية التعامل من ال HCID إلى مركز العدوى الوطنية والوقاية (IPC)\n\nأي أنّه تغيير في التصنيف يخص بريطانيا فقط، وله علاقة بالأمور التنظيمية لا غير،\n\nوعلى ذلك لم تعتبر منظمة الصحة العالمية ولا بريطانيا أنّ ملف كورونا قد أُغلق، وليس صحيحًا أنّه سيتم بذلك رفع الإجراءات الوقائية مثل التباعد الاجتماعي والحجر الصحي.\n\nبل على العكس، ففي المؤتمر الصحفي (مكتوب هنا) المنعقد لمنظمة الصحة في 10/06/2020،\n\nأكّد المدير العام لمنظمة الصحة العالمية “تيدروس أدهانوم غبريسوس”،\n\nأنّ الأشخاص الذين لا يظهرون الأعراض يمكنهم نقل العدوى،\n\nوأن تتبّع المخالطين للأشخاص المصابين بالفيروس والاستمرار في إجراءات الحجر الصحي هو الحل الأمثل للحد من انتشار الفيروس،\n\nتقييم فتبينوا: زائف.\n\nبناءً على ما سبق قرّرت منصة فتبينوا تصنيف الادعاءات القائلة بأن:\n\nمنظمة الصحة تعتبر بصفة نهائية الأشخاص المصابين بالأعراض فقط -وخاصة درجة الحرارة- ناقلين للفيروس؛\n\nلم يعد هنالك داع لإجراء الفخوصات ولا للتباعد الإجتماعي، ولا لإجراءات الحجر الصحي لغير المصابين بالأعراض؛\n\nيتم التوجيه بالفتح والعودة للحياة الطبيعية ونهاية وإغلاق ملف كورونا؛\n\nقررت تصنيفها على أنها زائفة، لأنها تنقل حقائق علمية وصحفية تحمل العديد من الجزئيات الزائفة، وتستعمل وثائق رسمية في غير ما أصدرت له.\n\nخطر هذه الادعاءات:\n\nهذه الادّعاءات وانتشارها يعطي إحساسًا زائفًا بالأمان مما يتسبب في تقليل الحذر من العديد من الأشخاص بحسب الباحثة الأمريكية في علم النفس April Thames،\n\nتقليل حذر الأشخاص قد يؤدي إلى عدم التزامهم بالإجراءات الموصى بها لتقليل الإصابات بفيروس كورونا،\n\nوهذا بدوره يرفع من احتمالية إصابة الشخص الذي صدّق مثل هذا الادّعاء.\n\nيمكنك مراجعة مجموعة أخرى من الأخبار التي تحقّقت منها المنصة حول جائحة كورونا من
