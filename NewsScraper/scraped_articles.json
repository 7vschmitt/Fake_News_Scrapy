Various participants are spreading false information on platforms such as Youtube and Facebook. A data analysis conducted by CORRECTIV.Faktencheck shows that Youtube is the platform most frequently reported by users for spreading questionable information. Around 46 percent of the links sent to us requesting a fact check lead to the video platform.\n\nAt the same time, Whatsapp is the most important distribution channel: 34 percent of users declared that Whatsapp is where they had seen the potentially false information for the first time. You could say that Whatsapp is the motorway for fake news related to the coronavirus, with Youtube videos being the racing cars.\n\nThe result: the dissemination of false information can be huge within the shortest of timeframes. According to a recent survey conducted by Forsa and commissioned by the regional media office of North Rhine-Westphalia, 81 percent of people in Germany believe that they have already come across disinformation about the coronavirus on the internet.\n\nThe source of the evaluated data is CORRECTIV\u2019s CrowdNewsroom, and they are not representative. Readers have been able to submit content that they consider to require a fact- check to the site that to require since mid-March. We have evaluated more than 1,800 reports over all. They are based on users\u2019 subjective assessments which pieces of information could be false. Thus, not all of them are necessarily fake.\n\nHowever, what the submissions clearly show is which posts about the coronavirus have made people uncertain or aroused their mistrust, and the way in which this information reaches them.\n\nThe platform: around 46 percent of the links lead to Youtube\n\nYoutube\u2019s particular importance becomes clear when you take a look at the platforms that appear most frequently in our data: An analysis of more than 1,400 links submitted to the CrowdNewsroom shows that 45.8 percent lead to videos on Youtube.\n\nSecond place goes to websites with 30.6 percent, followed by Facebook with 16.6 percent. As there is no way to create links to Whatsapp, the instant messenger cannot be included in this evaluation.\n\nThis means that by far the most frequent source of potentially false information reported to us by readers are Youtube videos.\n\nThe dissemination method: 34 percent state that they received the information via Whatsapp\n\nWhen asked where they came across the information for the first time, 34 percent of users answered that it was Whatsapp. Facebook follows in second place with 28.8 percent. 14.2 percent of users indicated Youtube as their first contact, while 7.6 percent said it was websites.\n\nWhatsapp is the way most people first come into contact with potentially false information \u2013 for example, because it was sent to them by family or friends.\n\nThus, Whatsapp is the most common dissemination channel for questionable information \u2013 and Youtube is the place where it can be found.\n\nThe result of our data analysis reflects the great importance of these two platforms on the German market. According to an ARD-ZDF online survey (2019), 40 percent of the population as a whole access Youtube at least once a week. The video platform is particularly popular with younger internet users: 82 percent of people aged 14 to 29 visit it at least once a week.\n\nBut Whatsapp is even more widespread in Germany: In 2019, 75 percent used the instant messenger at least once a week. In the case of people aged between 14 and 49, this figure even increases to more than 90 percent. Facebook is used by 31 percent of all people at least once a week.\n\nFalse information on health subjects is dangerous\n\nThe fact that false information on health issues is being disseminated over social networks is not new \u2013 but the corona crisis has aggravated the problem.\n\nFalse reports about Covid-19 spread internationally. For example, Whatsapp messages claiming that you should always take your shoes off at your front door because the coronavirus adheres to them, were sent in Germany, Ireland, and Croatia. And the false claim that drinking a sip of water every 15 minutes prevents infection, circulated on Whatsapp in Germany and Spain and on Facebook in Lithuania, Croatia, and the Philippines.\n\nNumerous doctors, including virologist Christian Drosten, recently asked large technology companies in an open letter to act against the \u201cinfodemic\u201d. The operators of the platforms should \u201ctake immediate systemic action to stem the flow of health misinformation, and the public health crisis it has triggered\u201d. The doctors also refer to cheap propaganda targeting the vaccinations against measles as an example of this.\n\n\u201cOnce a piece of fake news gets into someone\u2019s mind, it is anchored there in a relatively stable manner\u201d\n\nSabrina Heike Kessler, of the Department of Communication and Media Research at the University of Zurich is a communication scientist specializing in science communication. She says: \u201cThe fact that people believe in fake news concerning health issues can also be explained by the human desire to be healthy, stay healthy, or to get well, and the fear of illness and death.\u201d When it comes to health, human beings are evolutionarily designed to rely on the thinking, recommending, and actions of others.\n\nThis is partly the reason of why false information about Covid-19 is spreading so swiftly, Kessler explains to CORRECTIV. \u201cIf the information that you read about the coronavirus is also plausible and fits into your own world view, it is stored directly in your mind. Once a piece of fake news gets into someone\u2019s mind, it is anchored there in a relatively stable manner and it is exceedingly difficult to remove.\u201d\n\nWhat are technology companies doing about this?\n\nYoutube, Whatsapp, and Facebook don\u2019t remain idle when faced with these issues. They are already taking measures to limit the spread of false reports.\n\nThus, Whatsapp has, since early April, restricted the forwarding of messages, which can now only be re-sent to a maximum of five chats. In addition, messages that have previously been forwarded five times can only be sent to one further chat. Upon request, Whatsapp informed us that this has reduced the amount of heavily forwarded messages by 70 percent.\n\nWhatsapp also emphasizes that they support the work of fact checkers worldwide, as well as working with public authorities. In fact, users have recently been able to communicate with the WHO or the German Federal Ministry of Health on the subject of Covid-19 via a Whatsapp chatbot.\n\nThe Facebook company, which owns Whatsapp, has been cooperating with independent fact checkers like CORRECTIV for several years. As a result, people who have shared incorrect information on the social network are, also retrospectively, informed about this fact. In addition, Facebook states that posts about the coronavirus \u201cthat could pose an imminent threat to physical harm\u201d are deleted on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nYoutube: \u201cWe are working at full blast\u201d\n\nYoutube has no fact-checking program yet. The company removes videos with false medical information about Covid-19. Youtube spokesman Georg Nolte informed us by email that an example for this would be videos that claim that the coronavirus doesn\u2019t exist. Or that recommend \u201cmedically unsubstantiated methods\u201d to avoid infection and prevent people from getting treatment. He also states that videos \u201cexplicitly denying the effectiveness of the guidelines of the WHO or the respective health authority, which could lead to people violating these guidelines\u201d are deleted.\n\n\u201cWe are working at full blast to protect our users from misinformation and want to connect them to reliable and helpful messages,\u201d says Nolte. In consultation with the German Federal Ministry of Health, info boxes were installed under the relevant videos, on the homepage, and in the search feature on Youtube. \u201cWe want to draw the attention of as many people as possible to the information panels of the Ministry and the related institutes. From a global perspective, we have already generated 14 billion impressions on the information pages of the various health organizations.\u201d\n\nIn Germany, Youtube has, for some time now, actually displayed a link to the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) in videos on Covid-19.\n\nBut is this enough? Some videos are not deleted because it isn\u2019t evident that they meet the criteria mentioned. They usually have a lot of opinion content \u2013 and they are often misleading. An example of this is a 30-minute post by blogger Ken Jebsen, in which he makes several false claims and speculates that Bill Gates has taken control of healthcare in order to push through a forced administration of vaccines. Numerous readers have referred us to this KenFM Youtube video, with, by now, more than three million views.\n\nA video interview with Stefan Homburg, in which he claims that the government\u2019s lockdown was unnecessary and ineffective, is also still online, although in the introduction moderator Milena Preradovic urges all viewers to please adhere to regulations regarding the coronavirus. On the other hand, it is, for example, no longer possible to find a video that places the statements of an Italian doctor on the coronavirus into the wrong context.\n\nChain letters on Whatsapp or videos on Youtube often reach extremely wide coverage before the first fact checks or media reports on them are published. And Youtube\u2019s reference to the Federal Centre for Health Education, which is also displayed below Ken Jebsen\u2018s video, can be misleading under certain circumstances. Users who don\u2019t know the background might actually consider it an indication of the seriousness of the claims therein.\n\nThe reference to the Federal Centre for Health Education appears below a video in which Ken Jebsen claims that Bill Gates took control of the health system to push through a forced administration of vaccines. (Screenshot: CORRECTIV)\n\nAccording to an assessment by communication scientist Kessler, Youtube tries to counter false reports and agitation, but: \u201cYoutube will only be able to chase the fake news disseminators unless fundamentally new measures are taken.\u201d\n\nAnother problem is that big companies release few data for scientific studies. \u201cBoth Youtube and Whatsapp are difficult to study for the field of social science research,\u201d says Kessler. Nobody knows exactly what the extent of the false reports about the coronavirus look like on there.\n\nIn her view, companies need to do more. They should \u201cinvest more money, hire more people to track down fake news, cooperate more with independent fact checkers and work more with independent social science researchers to effectively and adequately combat the spread of fake news.\u201d\n\nSpecial Evaluation: Below we list the five Youtube channels that were most frequently reported to CORRECTIV Schwindelambulanz Sinsheim / Dr. Bodo Schiffmann Videos by Bodo Schiffmann, a doctor who operates a clinic for diseases like vertigo in Sinsheim, were submitted to us 131 times. He opposes the government\u2019s coronavirus measures and recently even founded a party: \u201eWiderstand2020\u201d (\u201cResistance 2020\u201d). As if by assembly line, Schiffmann has been producing videos on the coronavirus for weeks. His videos are full of speculation \u2013 something reflected by the frequency with which readers submitted them to the CrowdNewsroom. eingeSCHENKt.tv Videos from the Youtube channel \u201ceingeSCHENKt.tv\u201d were reported 73 times. Journalist Thomas Schenk is behind this channel, with 85,000 subscribers, and posts that are more political than scientific in nature. Previous to the coronavirus crisis, videos with titles such as \u201cCO2 und Klima(l\u00fcge)?\u201d (\u201cCO2 and climate [lie]?\u201d) were published there, as well as interviews with Max Otte from the Values Union of the CDU, or the right-wing Youtuber Heiko Schrang. Currently, the channel frequently reports on the so-called hygiene demos. Prof. Dr. med. Sucharit Bhakdi Sucharit Bhakdi is Professor Emeritus of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene at the University of Mainz. Links to his videos were sent to us by users 43 times. His Youtube channel was created just a few weeks ago and has around 71,000 subscribers \u2013 but some of his videos record one to two million views. KenFM \u201cKenFM\u201d is the Youtube channel of blogger Ken Jebsen and counts 466,000 subscribers. In his videos, he generally downplays the dangerousness of the coronavirus and expresses suspicion about a big conspiracy behind the pandemic, including, among others, Bill Gates as puppet master. KenFM\u2019s posts were sent to the CrowdNewsroom 34 times. PUNKT.Preradovic Videos from \u201cPUNKT.Preradovic\u201d, the Youtube channel of the former RTL presenter Milena Preradovic, with 37,000 subscribers, were reported 33 times. Among others, she interviewed Sucharit Bhakdi, who claimed that vaccinations against the coronavirus are \u201csenseless\u201d; economist Stefan Homburg, who considered the lockdown as unnecessary and superfluous; and physician Wolfgang Wodarg, who questioned the dangerousness of the coronavirus.\n\nText: Alice Echtermann\n\nData Analysis: Michel Penke, Max Donheiser\n\nGraphics: Benjamin Schubert\n\nCooperation with the CrowdNewsroom: Till Eckert, Bianca Hoffmann, Matthias Bau, Steffen Kutzner"}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/latest-stories/cumex-files-en/2020/05/12/eu-banking-authority-on-cum-ex-trades-no-coordination-between-national-supervisors/", "published": "2020-05-12T16:51:38", "title": "EU Banking Authority on Cum-Ex Trades: No coordination between national supervisors", "text": "von Olaya Arg\u00fceso , Justus von Daniels\n\nIt has taken the European Banking Authority (EBA) a year and a half to realise what CORRECTIV and its partners exposed through the CumEx Files investigation: There is no cooperation between national authorities in the EU, which gave criminals leeway to carry out illegal dividend arbitrage trades across the Union for decades.\n\nThe EBA published a report Tuesday in response to a request by the EU Parliament after the publication of the CumEx Files. Sven Giegold, financial and economic policy spokesperson of the Greens/EFA group, described the report as \u201cembarrassing\u201d. Giegold said that the banking supervisor \u201cdoes not respond in the slightest to Parliament\u2019s questions\u201d. Shortly after the CumEx Files came to light in October 2018, the EU Parliament demanded a detailed investigation and a plan to prevent such schemes in the future.\n\nThrough the so called cum-ex trades, bankers, lawyers and traders executed dividend arbitrage deals in different tax jurisdictions with the aim of filing multiple tax claims of the same withholding tax. The business model was based on plundering the public treasury. According to CORRECTIV\u2019s investigation, they could have robbed over \u20ac55bn since the beginning of the 2000s. The first trial has just finished in Bonn (Germany), where two traders have been granted suspended sentences.\n\nSince May 2019, the EBA has carried out two surveys among the national banking supervisors on the risk the cum-ex trades could pose in terms of money laundering and financing of terrorism, and in connection with the governance of financial institutions.\n\nThe findings are devastating: each country has a different understanding of which activities are considered tax crime, which means not every country considers cum-ex trades as a criminal activity, and even in those member states where some kind of criminal investigation was going on, the supervisors did not take action because \u201cthey were waiting for the outcome of criminal investigations before considering the impact on their sector\u201d, according to the report. What is more, most of the surveyed supervising bodies did not cooperate with other public authorities in their jurisdiction (such as tax authorities) or in other member states because they thought their country had not been a target of these schemes.\n\nCORRECTIV\u2019s investigation exposed the key role that financial institutions played in facilitating the cum-ex trades. However, according to the EBA\u2019s surveys, most national supervising authorities (namely, each country\u2019s central bank) did not take any action against the banks involved in the dividend arbitrage schemes.\n\nAs a result of its analysis, the EBA admits that cooperation and information exchange between public authorities \u201cappear to have been attempted in a minority of cases and only where risks had crystallised\u201d. The institution also recognises that the complexity of EU laws is another hurdle for cooperation: \u201cThis may make the exchange of information between competent authorities and tax authorities difficult\u201d, writes the EBA.\n\nAfter gathering the responses to its survey among national supervisors, the EBA laid out a 10 point action plan to boost the \u201cfuture\u201d regulation applicable to such schemes, which consists on amending a series of guidelines on the internal governance of banks, the suitability of their managers and anti money laundering supervision. Most of these updates will not be published until the first half of 2021. The EBA also plans a further inquiry \u201cinto the actions taken by financial institutions and national authorities within their competencies to supervise compliance with requirements applicable to\u201d cum-ex trades. They have not yet set a date.\n\nIn Giegold\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe patchwork of national supervisors together with a weak European Banking Authority is dysfunctional\u201d, and called for a complete overhaul of EBA\u2019s decision-making structures.\n\nIn response to CORRECTIV\u2019s questions, the EBA wrote that its report \u201cidentified a number of issues with regard to the role of national authorities in fighting dividend arbitrage trading schemes\u201d. However, it also admits that \u201csome of these issues are beyond the remit and powers of national supervisory authorities or the EBA\u201d."}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/hintergrund-en/2020/05/12/datenanalyse-nutzer-finden-fragwuerdige-corona-informationen-vor-allem-auf-youtube-und-verbreiten-sie-ueber-whatsapp/", "published": "2020-05-12T14:27:47", "title": "Datenanalyse: Nutzer finden fragw\u00fcrdige Corona-Informationen vor allem auf Youtube und verbreiten sie \u00fcber Whatsapp", "text": ""}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/top-stories-en/2020/06/08/kickonpills/", "published": "2020-06-08T20:59:33", "title": "A Kick On Pills \u2013 Painkillers in Football", "text": "I\u2019m ready. It\u2019s a warm, midsummer day in the Austrian winter sports resort of Seefeld. The aroma of fir trees saturates the air. The tires of my mountain bike are full, and I have already had a first test ride. Stretched out before me is a white, pebble trail that leads from the small mountain village of M\u00f6sern through a fir forest in the Austrian Alps, and pastures that extend to the sports fields. At this precise moment, the football players of the Bundesliga club RB Leipzig are training there, finishing warm-up exercises with a view of the ski jump. They will have to pass me on their way out.\n\nMany international clubs travel to Austria to prepare for the summer season. In the shadow of the Alps, the Champions League semi-finalist Ajax Amsterdam, as well as several clubs from England and Russia, are getting ready for the 2019 tournaments. They use the time to brace themselves for the stress of the coming months. Now, the players from Leipzig are doing circuit training in front of me.\n\nIt\u2019s been three months since nine colleagues and I started our investigation into painkiller abuse in football. As a journalist, you sometimes have to follow unusual paths. At this point in time, we\u2018ve made 73 phone calls and written countless emails. We\u2019ve contacted physicians, officials, and football professionals from the German Bundesliga with requests to tell us about their experiences. Some of them asked to have their name redacted. Others spoke out openly.\n\nThey talked about Voltaren, opioids, and infusions. Some mention performance-enhancing substances and painkillers distributed in locker rooms as if they were candy, and report dubious practices in clubs abroad. Others do not want to say anything. It is particularly difficult to approach active players. They are shielded by their clubs.\n\nThe training field in the Austrian Alps where RB Leipzig players prepare for the 2019 season. \u00a9 Jonathan Sachse\n\nI look further down the slope, trying to see if anybody is already there. On one side of the mountain is the training ground, reserved for two weeks by their club. On the other side, the luxury hotel where the players spend the training season. Unlike racing cyclists who train up to eight hours per day, football players \u2013 even professionals \u2013 get a large chuck of free time in between practices. They idle away the hours playing PlayStation or poker. The players from Leipzig come to the sports field twice a day, for an hour and a half each time. After that, as I observed the day before, most players will ride their bicycles on the gravel road for 3 kilometers back to the hotel. Once there, no one from the club\u2019s press department will be present.\n\nThis could be my chance. My plan is to catch up with them by bike, say hello, and start a friendly conversation. \u201cOh, so you\u2019re professional football players?\u201d Then, I\u2019ll skillfully approach the subject of interest. As a journalist, I\u2019m looking for players who will talk about their everyday life \u2013 injuries, pressure, recovery \u2013 about testing limits, and about painkillers. Because that is exactly what our investigation is about.\n\nThe largest five European football leagues \u2013 located in England, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France \u2014 generated more than 15 billion euros in the 2017/18 season. The European Championship, a competition across 12 countries \u2014 now cancelled due to COVID-19 \u2014 was posed to earn another billion euros in revenue. Needless to say, the football industry is thriving. It is a product that pays as long as the competition is fit. With millions to be earned in salaries and bonuses, there is also incentive for players to stay in the game.\n\nBy 35, most players are at the end of their career. But until then, many want to earn as much as possible. The pressure to perform is high. If your body starts gives out, it must be helped \u2013 with painkillers and possibly other substances. Because, in this business, hardly anyone can afford injuries or pain.\n\nThe first players are approaching. Three, then seven, then eleven on bikes. The training is over. Midfielder Kevin Kampl is part of the group, recognizable by his bleached hair. I also recognize Timo Werner and Marcel Sabitzer. I turn onto the gravel path and let two of the players from Leipzig pass me. Three more follow. They are riding pretty fast. Is the return trip part of the training? I accelerate and try to at least keep up with the next group, fighting my way up the slope \u2013 but I still can\u2019t get close. The headwind caused by two midfielders carries away my timid \u201chello\u201d, and the hope of getting insider information with it. After two minutes even the last one in front of me has disappeared into the fir forest. Bundesliga professionals. On e-bikes. Faster than a curious journalist.\n\nIn 2002, the world football association, FIFA, started to research the abuse of painkillers in football. FIFA experts were soon able to prove that painkillers are part of everyday life at the World Cup. In 2018, one in four players in Russia took painkillers before each match \u2014 one particular player even used three different painkillers. The findings of the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups in 2005 and 2007 were also shocking: almost half of the players took painkillers while competing at the tournament.\n\nFIFA\u2019s internal research into painkillers was developed by physician Jiri Dvorak. Under his leadership, and after several tournaments, the sheets showing the medications taken by all national players during the 72 hours before kick-off were evaluated. \u201cThe result was devastating,\u201d says Dvorak. \u201cWhen we evaluated the numbers, we saw that the consumption of medications is enormous.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team, Dvorak remembers a sheet in which all 23 players confessed to having taken Voltaren, and some of them even to having taken an additional painkiller. Another table showed five different medications given to a young player for a single match. \u201cTaking painkillers for prophylactic purposes is misuse,\u201d says Dvorak. \u201cIt absolutely cannot be justified scientifically and is counterproductive\u201d.\n\nThe 71-year-old Swiss citizen with Czech roots stopped working for FIFA in 2016. The new president, Gianni Infantino, closed the entire medical research department previously headed by Dvorak. Today, the physician demands that \u201c[p]ainkillers should be banned if they are not medically necessary\u201d.\n\nFIFA\u2019s figures show that painkiller abuse is not just a problem in German football. Most football players stay silent about their experience with Voltaren and other medications. Their stories only appear occasionally in press reports.\n\nOne of them is Daniel Agger, who played 232 matches for Liverpool in the Premier League. \u201cI have taken too much anti-inflammatories in my career, my body could not cope with it,\u201d he said in an interview with the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in 2016. Throughout his entire career, he had taken painkillers in excess of the recommended dose. The spring of 2015 was no exception: at this point he had switched to the Danish club Brondby and wanted to play at the local derby despite an injury. He took four tablets in the hours before the match. On the field, he no longer had control over his body and had to be substituted after half an hour. A short time later he had to end his career, at the age of 31. \u201cMaybe my story will make other athletes take fewer pills,\u201d said Agger.\n\nAfter the end of his career, former Liverpool defender Daniel Agger spoke openly about painkiller abuse. \u00a9 Eddie Keogh / picture alliance / REUTERS\n\nStories like Agger\u2019s prompted us to address the painkiller abuse with journalists from other major football-playing nations and to speak with more professionals. From. There, CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team began collaborating with French journalists from France 2 and with colleagues from Italian La Stampa and Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI).\n\nEven though the considerable amount of painkiller consumption has been acknowledged for the past 18 years, the general reaction to their abuse seems absurd from a medical standpoint: more and more matches and competitions are being held, posing additional challenges for the players, only intensifying the pressure and scope of abuse.\n\nUnlike doping agents, medications for pain and inflammation in competitive sports are generally legal \u2014 something that several insiders think is wrong. \u201cYou can simply perform better with painkillers,\u201d says Hans Geyer, a doping researcher from Cologne. The scientist demands that painkillers be classified as doping agents. \u201cPainkillers,\u201d says Geyer, \u201care extremely harmful to health.\u201d According to the definition by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), a substance must be included in the list of prohibited drugs if it fulfills two of a total of three doping criteria. Painkillers conform to two criteria on account of the increase in performance and the damage to health. This is how Geyer sees it.\n\nWe started our investigation looking into the abuse of prescription drugs in football. For this purpose, CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team joined forces. It soon became clear: beyond prescription drugs, the abuse of painkillers is also a problem \u2013 and possibly a more pressing one.\n\nIn response to a survey, 1142 amateur footballers shared their experiences with painkillers and doping. We also interviewed over 100 professional football players, most of them from the Bundesliga. Some finished their careers in the 1990s and early 2000s, others of them only recently. Three of them are currently playing. All of these professionals shared their experiences with us. One of them is Jonas Hummels, the younger brother of the national player Mats Hummels.\n\nIn December 2015, nine days before Christmas, Jonas Hummels was suffering from severe pain. His knee had been plaguing him for months. Before training, he took the painkiller Arcoxia. After sprinting away, he suddenly came to a stop, screaming. His kneecap was pressing on a nerve. At this point, jumping and landing after a header would simply no longer be possible.\n\n\u201cYou could tell me nine times that I was taking too many painkillers. And nine times I would not have listened to you,\u201d Hummels says today. At the time, though, he remembers ignoring the consequences of the substance abuse.\n\nJonas Hummels speaks out about the dark side of professional football and the consumption of painkillers. \u00a9 Ralph Ziegenhorn for EyeOpening.Media\n\nOne week later, Hummels faced the Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen alongside his team, the Spielvereinigung Unterhaching. They were one of the final 16 teams left in the DFB Cup. It could be the highlight of his career. Hummels was the captain of the third-division club and normally, he would lead his team onto the field. But he already had to give up that plan. At the very least, he wanted to be part of the team on the field, to get out there somehow, maybe even substituted in.\n\nBefore the match, Hummels tried taking the usual painkillers but realized they don\u2019t work. The pain is too strong. His body had built up a tolerance. But he desperately wanted to be on the field and the team\u2019s physician wanted to help him, too, before a match that would be so important to the captain. The orthopedist suggested a local anesthesia to Hummels. It was his only chance.\n\nHummels agrees. One hour before the match, the physician injects Hummels\u2019 knee four times and presses the serum into his veins. Three hours later, his team loses the cup match against the first division\u2019s Leverkusen 1-3. Hummels did not play for a single minute, but he was there. He later described the evening as a \u201csupreme highlight\u201d.\n\nThat night was the end for Jonas Hummels. With cruciate ligament ruptures and cartilage damage in both knees, Hummels could hardly climb stairs without feeling pain at the age of 25.\n\nLike Hummels, many players rely on the short-term effects of painkillers. Sometimes they know absolutely nothing about possible long-term consequences. But they can be severe: Muscle injuries, damage to kidneys, liver, and joints. Arthrosis at a young age, and a higher risk of heart problems.\n\nIn some cases, players develop questionable routines that may only become dangerous for them at a later time. The story of a player who wants to remain anonymous and played for years in the lower professional leagues in Italy is an example of this. \u201cEvery Saturday evening before the match, I would go to the hospital, where a friend of mine injected cortisone into my fingers or legs so I could play the next day,\u201d says the former goalkeeper, who is now a coach. As a thank you for the treatment, he would give the doctor a bottle of wine. During his career he played in multiple leagues, and some of his teammates played for different A-series clubs.\n\nHe ended his career at the age of 41. \u201cI could no longer jump to the right, but I made a good wage and needed the money,\u201d he says about his health at the end of his sports career. For years, his family had been able to live on what he earned as a semi-professional football player. Today, he says, \u201cI ruined my body.\u201d\n\nIn addition to visits to the hospital, he also used painkillers on his own for more than 20 years, among them Aulin, which has the active ingredient nimesulide. \u201cBefore each game, I would take two Aulin tablets, without water.\u201d By the end of his career, he was on the brink of kidney failure and had already undergone five operations.\n\nSuch testimonials show how painkiller abuse slowly turns into addiction. Despite our failed investigation with RB Leipzig at Seefeld, we still succeeded in having conversations in Austria with the managers of other Bundesliga teams that were also preparing for the 2019/20 season in the Alps. We held an off-the-record conversation with a Bundesliga physician there and received telephone numbers for further research. At the end of a trip that took us through six training camps, it is at least clear that we have to talk to more people in the professional football system if we want to learn more about substances and methods.\n\nUnlike Hummels, most former football professionals do not want share their history with painkiller abuse. They do not even want to be quoted anonymously. A \u201ctough guy mentality\u201d permeates the sport. Few people even dare to talk about weaknesses after finishing their career. Their stories show how, for decades, footballers have become ill due to the use of painkillers. Stiff feet, early arthrosis, life-threatening atrial fibrillation; they now have to live with these physical issues for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn spring, we meet Thomas Fr\u00f6lich, TSG Hoffenheim\u2019s team physician. During his time in paid football, he has worked with numerous successful coaches, such as Joachim L\u00f6w, Felix Magath and Ralf Rangnick, and most recently, Julian Nagelsmann. He is often with the team, says Fr\u00f6lich, which means he can control access to medications. He only releases tablets \u201cin limited quantities\u201d.\n\nThomas Fr\u00f6lich, now the TSG Hoffenheim team doctor, says he talked frequently with players about their consumption of painkillers. \u00a9 EyeOpening.Media\n\nHowever, even Hoffenheim\u2019s team doctor eases access to medication as kick-off draws closer. \u201cIf someone comes to me 45 minutes before the match, I cannot argue with him for half an hour, so I am a little more generous,\u201d said the team doctor. Fr\u00f6lich said that again and again, players who are new to the club ask him for painkillers, often out of routine. \u201cThen you have to try to get them out of the habit,\u201d says Fr\u00f6lich. \u201cBecause he often has no pain at all.\u201d\n\nIn addition, football clubs cannot constantly control their players. Common pain relievers are actually available in low doses in any pharmacy without a prescription. For example, ibuprofen brands is sold over the counter, up to a dosage of 400 mg.\n\nAn anecdote from 1998 shows the consequences of taking painkillers without medical control. At the time, Fr\u00f6lich\u2019s VfB Stuttgart was in the UEFA Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final match against Chelsea. The team doctor had prescribed Voltaren for a player, but he spat blood after the match. The reason: the player had also taken aspirin on his own volition. The combination of the active ingredients of both medications increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Fr\u00f6lich gave the player infusions and kept stayed by his bed. The player survived the night. At some point his stomach stopped bleeding.\n\nJonas Hummels also remembers medicine cabinets filled to the brim with painkillers. If you wanted ibuprofen, you usually got it. A former Bundesliga player, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that a few years ago a physiotherapist was standing at the entrance to the team\u2019s bus and was holding a bag of painkillers: everyone could help themselves freely before leaving for the match.\n\nThe conscious use of medication to improve performance in professional football has already played a role in the past. A court case against Riccardo Agricola proves that. The Italian was a doctor in the dominant Juventus team in the 1990s, which included the players Alessandro del Piero, Didier Deschamps, and Zinedine Zidane. Agricola was accused of systematically influencing player performance by means of medications. \u201cIt turned out that the majority of the medication was not used in accordance with prescriptions and therefore not for the treatment of specific diseases,\u201d says the first-instance judgment in 2004, to which CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team gained access. The Juve professionals did not receive painkillers for therapeutic purposes. \u201cIf there is no possibility of using painkillers, it would not be easy to play all the matches of the championship,\u201d two former players of the team are quoted as saying in the case file.\n\nAt that time, prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello led the investigation, and the 79-year-old man still feels frustrated so many years later. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a single witness who wanted to speak,\u201d he told us over the phone. The code of silence of professional football applies any time and anywhere.\n\nNeven Subotic is the only active professional player who agreed to speak publicly about painkillers for our investigation. We met him at CORRECTIV\u2019s office in Berlin. Spring is approaching but it\u2019s still cold outside.\n\nSubotic started his professional career at the age of 18 with the 1. FSV Mainz 05 under coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Later Klopp brought him to Dortmund. Twice, Subotic and his club were named German champions. Today, he plays for Union Berlin. In total, he has played more than 200 Bundesliga matches. He also stood on the field with the Serbian national team at the 2010 World Cup.\n\nNeven Subotic speaks at CORRECTIV\u2019s Berlin office about the painkiller crisis in German football. \u00a9 EyeOpening.Media\n\n\u201cI believe the whole system is missing an official who can sure that everything is done properly,\u201d says Subotic. At the moment, football regulations work through the transfer of pressure. It is about earning more money. The clubs needs to be successful, and so the coaches feels pressured. The coach passes on the pressure to their assistant coaches or to the physicians. \u201cAnd in the end, it\u2019s the player who gets the most pressure. He can\u2019t play unless he takes painkillers.\u201d The central defender also played in France for a year and a half, where the system is similar \u2013 as well as the problematic consumption of painkillers.\n\nHe hardly uses painkillers himself, says Subotic, and that he\u2019d rather miss a match. At the same time, he observes how ibuprofen is distributed for \u201cevery little pain\u201d. He advises younger players to act on their own and regularly seek an opinion from external doctors who do not have a conflict of interest with the club. \u201cAnd in the end, it\u2019s the player who suffers the most pressure and who has the most to lose,\u201d Subotic says. If a player sustains permanent damage, he is quickly out on his own.\n\nNeven Subotic demands that players must also learn more about the medications that are often part of their day-to-day work. \u201cWhat I have noticed in the past 14 years is that ibuprofen is distributed like candy. For every little pain they immediately give you ibuprofen,\u201d says Subotic. He says he wishes that the effects of painkillers on former football players were investigated. \u201cWe need information about what happens after the career ends and the cases should also be made public anonymously \u2013 as a warning.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, three studies have provided answers to the question of the harmful effects of painkillers. They confirm that the regular use of painkillers increases the likelihood of experiencing significant heart problems. In a 2011 study, Swiss researchers found that diclofenac (Voltaren) and etoricoxib (Arcoxia), both popular among footballers, increases the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Danish scientists also found that diclofenac significantly increases that risk. The same applies to ibuprofen. And two years ago, another Danish study confirmed that diclofenac increases the rate of developing a heart problem during the first 30 days after ingestion.\n\nIbuprofen 400 can be bought at any pharmacy without a prescription, making it one of the most popular painkillers among football players. \u00a9 Collage von Ivo Mayr\n\n\u201cThere is a clear link between death caused by a heart attack and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\u201d explains Gunnar Gislason. He is one of the Danish researchers who works with heart related risks. \u201cThese medications affect the cardiovascular system. We know that they affect blood pressure, that they affect the kidneys.\u201d As a result, painkillers can indeed kill. So is the story of one player from France.\n\nOn April 6, 2018, Samba Diop comes home from training. The 18-year-old plays for the second division club Le Havre AC. He was doing lighter training after having to stop for a few weeks because of mononucleosis. When he gets home, he tells his mother that he does not feel well. He gets worse, vomits several times, and collapses on the way to the toilet at 3:30 a.m. His mother calls an ambulance.\n\nThe young talent is supposed to sign his first professional contract in the coming days. Were it not for the hip pain that has plagued Diop for weeks, he would also be playing an important match the next day. He talks to the medical department about it and, after the daily training, is sent to see a physician who injects him with the painkiller ketoprofen, which is often used for osteoarthritis. \u201cI\u2019m going to die and it\u2019s because of the injection,\u201d Samba later tells his mother at home. Arame Diop recalls this dramatic moment at the end of last year in a conversation with the media outlet Loopsider. There, Samba\u2019s mother describes the night and the course of events.\n\nSamba Diop is taken to the hospital in the middle of the night, where his condition worsens, and he dies in the morning. \u201cI want the club to tell me the truth, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Arame Diop, more than a year later, to the media outlet Loopsider.\n\n\u201cI want the club to break its silence\u201d, says Arame Diop. Her son Samba Diop, player at Le Havre AC (France), died after receiving an injection from the team doctor. \u00a9 Screenshot from Loopsider\n\nThe autopsy report, which CORRECTIV and ARD Doping Editorial Team obtained access to, states multi-organ failure as a preliminary cause of death \u2013 a possible side effect of ketoprofen. However, for two years, no definitive answers have been given regarding the cause Samba Diop\u2019s death . \u201cThe autopsy leaves the cause of death open. It is not possible to know the exact reasons. But it excludes some options such as a pre-existing heart condition,\u201d says Yassine Bouzrou, who represents the Diop family in a lawsuit against the club. It is about who is to blame for Samba\u2019s death. The family has sued the authorities of the club and the physician for manslaughter.\n\nFor two years, lawyer Bouzrou has been asking for complementary analyses and investigations. Since there has been no response by the French justice system, he threatens to bring the case before another court, Bouzrou told a collaborating France 2 reporter.\n\nThe Diop family still lives in uncertainty. Was the injection of painkillers the cause of Samba\u2019s death? The silence of those responsible speaks volumes about an industry in which painkillers help players to perform \u2013 but often at their own risk.\n\nThe issue of painkiller abuse in football does not always have such drastic consequences. According to our survey of over 1,100 football players, which cannot be considered representative, over half of participants used painkillers several times throughout a season to play football. More than 40 percent took painkillers not for therapeutic reasons, but to increase their performance.\n\nVery few are concerned with the consequences for their health. At the same time, hundreds report negative consequences: stomach problems, as well as liver and kidney damage. Several also reported becoming addicted to opioids when over-the-counter painkillers no longer worked.\n\nHalf of survey participants said they did not know about the increased risk of heart disease caused by painkiller use. Rather, amateur footballers reported that their coaches had given them pills before the match. When it comes to painkiller abuse, amateurs and professionals play in the same league.\n\nThe German Football Association has always seen itself as protecting the interests of German amateur football players. Its current president, Fritz Keller, has been in office since September 2019. In mid-May we met Keller at the DFB\u2019s headquarters in Frankfurt am Main and show him the results of our survey.\n\nKeller looks concerned. He sends a clear message in a time when for-profit football is accused of focusing more on the money than on the health of players. Painkiller abuse is not entirely new to him, said Keller. But at the professional football club SC Freiburg, which he headed for a long time, it was pointed out that the pills should not be taken in advance for possible injuries. \u201cPainkillers as prevention, that\u2019s just stupid.\u201d\n\nBut this is exactly how many amateur footballers use these medications. Keller says that this \u201cshocked\u201d him. \u201cWe absolutely have to go to our national associations and simply raise awareness through the trainers.\u201d The DFB\u2019s president summed up the painkiller issue by stating: \u201cThis is actually counterproductive. Amateur sports is intended to keep you healthy and not to break you.\u201d\n\nFritz Keller, president of the German Football Association (DFB), said he is \u201cshocked\u201d by survey results that show the widespread use of painkillers among amateur players. The survey was conducted by CORRECTIV and the ARD Doping Editorial Team. \u00a9 EyeOpening.Media\n\nFor Keller, painkiller abuse is a problem for society as a whole. In regards to football, he said he would \u201ccheck everything immediately and also draw attention to it in order to keep our athletes healthy\u201d. He also wants to implement whatever measures the DFB is able achieve in this matter.\n\nJust days before publication, the DFB clarified an earlier response to CORRECTIV\u2019s findings about painkiller abuse in football: \u201cRegarding the sensitization of amateur clubs, the DFB is currently planning an online webinar for clubs about the consumption of painkillers with doctor Toni Graf-Baumann\u201d, wrote a representative for the German Football Association in an email. Graf-Baumann, an expert in pain treatment, has been considered an authority about this problem for decades, especially in football associations. He is also a member of DFB\u2019s anti-doping commission. In their written response, the DFB also announced that they will be holding future conversations with the Federal Agency for Health Education.\n\nAs for professional football, the DFB representative wrote there are \u201cno hints\u201d that the consumption of painkillers in German football is different from other professional leagues in Europe. \u201cThis careless approach to painkillers and its many risks makes clear that much more educational work is needed.\u201d\n\nFrom the perspective of the two professional football players Neven Subotic and Jonas Hummels, measures against painkiller abuse are also necessary for highly paid players. \u201cAs far as I know, there is no major educational work done by clubs because they are also under pressure to get players fit as quickly as possible,\u201d says Subotic. Hummels also believes that \u201craising such public awareness would really make a lot of sense\u201d."}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/latest-stories/2020/04/01/how-is-coronavirus-impacting-you-we-want-to-listen/", "published": "2020-04-01T11:07:08", "title": "How is coronavirus impacting you? We want to listen.", "text": "von Marta Orosz\n\nRod Stone is one of the leading experts on VAT carousel fraud worldwide. For 40 years, he battled fraud at the HMRC, the UK\u2019s tax administration, and developed a comprehensive counter strategy. In 2015, he formed his own crime advisory company.\n\nCORRECTIV: The UK managed to reduce the annual loss to the treasury through VAT carousels from \u00a33 billion (\u20ac3.4 billion) to roughly \u00a3500 million. How was that possible?\n\nStone: In 2005, a number of VAT fraud prosecutions by the tax authorities failed. As a result, I developed something called the \u2018abusive right\u2019 principle, which allowed the customs service to disallow import tax claims with respect to people involved in carousel fraud. I was given about three months to see if I could come up with a civil law remedy. We first started using it in January 2006, and by June we had disallowed \u00a33.2 billion worth of import tax claims associated with carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: So that was it \u2013 stop the tax claims, and the fraud just stops?\n\nStone: Not quite. In the UK, we used a holistic strategy to combat the fraud. We had a tool box. We looked at all the ways of freezing money, because that also made the environment hostile for them. We would look at insolvency. With insolvency you would identify the missing trader, that\u2019s the importer, and raise a debt against him with the amount of tax that was due. The insolvency practitioner would then take over the running of the missing trader and seek to recover the missing money from everyone else in the \u2018supply chain\u2019. The supply chain, of course, was totally contrived and the only person who had any money was the person at the top, the exporter. So most of the insolvency practitioner\u2019s investigations would end up at that point and they would then seek to recover the money. They could also recover the money from the directors personally and they could use worldwide freezing orders to target bank accounts abroad, and that was quite a successful approach. We could obviously also use criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n\nCORRECTIV: How were they different in the UK?\n\nStone: The attraction of carousel fraud in most countries is that it doesn\u2019t carry the same penalties as drug trafficking or bank robbery. Criminals are looking at no more than five years in prison, and by half of that they\u2019ll be out. In the UK, we charge people or indict them with cheating the public revenue, and that carries a life prison sentence. In fact, the longest prison sentence that has been handed out has been 17 years, but it has been quite common for people to be sentenced to between 12 and 14 years for carousel fraud. And if they don\u2019t pay back the stolen money, they\u2019re brought back before the court, and their sentence is increased.\n\nCORRECTIV: How would you and your colleagues chase the fraudsters?\n\nStone: If I suspected that a company was involved in carousel fraud I could send in an officer the same day. That\u2019s part of our UK legislation and doesn\u2019t exist in many EU states. We would get all the sales and purchase records, and from those records we could see who they\u2019ve been buying from. If it\u2019s the first intermediary company above the missing trader, by going to that trader we will identify the missing trader. And at that point, we can go and visit the missing trader. Of course, there won\u2019t be anyone there. It\u2019s just a brass plate on an office block. But by establishing that it\u2019s not a legitimate trading company, we would cancel the VAT registration. We had officers out visiting traders on a daily basis.\n\nBut you knew that as soon as you took out one company and cancelled the VAT registration, within three or four days another company would be registered in its place and ready to go. So you had to continually monitor new company registrations, and who was behind them. We set up a system where every company we suspected of being involved in VAT carousel fraud was asked to clear the details of their suppliers and customers with a special unit in the tax administration. I would come to your office and say, \u201dI\u2019m instructing you to phone up this office, and tell them every time you\u2019re going to buy from someone new or sell to someone new.\u201d In that way, the tax administration built up a profile of all the companies that were involved \u2014 or probably involved \u2014 in carousel fraud.\n\nIn addition, if a VAT refund claim was submitted,it was submitted on a monthly basis, and those refund claims would be selected for verification. A verification meant that every transaction on which VAT was being claimed would be tracked down to the missing trader, and nobody got any money until we were satisfied that it wasn\u2019t part of a missing trader scheme.\n\nI have to say there were a lot of legal challenges and we had to go to court frequently to hold our ground, and the courts again were very supportive, because they were aware of the problem, they were aware of the complexities of the fraud and that the tax administration was putting a lot of resources into stopping illegal or illegitimate business without impacting on honest traders.\n\nTax administration HMRC in London. \u00a9 Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: Why don\u2019t other EU member states act the same way?\n\nStone: The problem is that some of the legislation that countries are using is antiquated. It\u2019s designed to deal with tax evaders, perhaps a man on the street corner who evades a small amount of tax, and the law has never been updated to deal with organized crime. Most of Europe hasn\u2019t kept up with the times. You have to put it through parliament, you have to get people to agree, and many European countries seem to have great difficulty in getting this process through.\n\nLikewise, the courts have to understand what they\u2019re dealing with. In our early prosecutions and our early civil cases, a lot of the judges had difficulty in understanding the issue. We actually had to devise a strategy for delivering the trial to the court case so that everybody understood how the fraud worked. We tried to simplify it. There were large tax companies that were trying to sell VAT carousel fraud as a tax avoidance scheme. Which of course it wasn\u2019t. The tax authorities contacted all the large accountancy firms and re-educated them into what they were dealing with.\n\nCORRECTIV: How can we imagine the prosecution process?\n\nStone: From the time you first become suspicious of the fraud to the date of conviction, you\u2019re looking at between three and five years. In the UK, we have an exemplary prosecution process or strategy. We would only prosecute the cases that had the biggest impact. Some of the major fraud chains were never prosecuted. But they lost their money because we used civil law strategies. There\u2019s only a limited number of investigators. When you conduct a raid and arrest everybody, you need 250 or 500 officers. So there is a big resource implication.\n\nThe prosecution \u2013 criminal law \u2014 strategy meant that the tax administration had a say in which ones it wanted to prosecute. Some EU member states insist that every identified case of carousel fraud is forwarded to the prosecutor. For that reason, the cases that have been investigated and prosecuted in some EU member countries are more than 10 years old before they come to the court. In the UK we didn\u2019t want stale cases. You probably won\u2019t get much money out of it and it doesn\u2019t send a message to the people currently involved in the fraud. You want to try and do it in real time. As much in real time as you can.\n\nAfter the UK introduced its strategy, the fraudsters looked at other countries in the EU. The VAT carousel fraud became so minimal in comparison with what it had been that we were able to move on to other things. That was until 2009, when the fraudsters moved into the carbon credit market.\n\nCORRECTIV: What happened?\n\nStone: The fraudsters started forming companies in France, and in the last quarter of 2007 they started trading large amounts of carbon credits through the BlueNext exchange in Paris. In January 2009, we became aware of a particular company in the UK selling tens of millions of euros of carbon credits to companies in France. We notified our French colleagues of the trader in France who received the carbon credits. We know from the audit that was carried out by the French audit office that the information wasn\u2019t acted on. In fact, I don\u2019t think the French visited the missing trader for about 5 months. This was largely because French legislation didn\u2019t allow the tax administration to make a visit to a trader until after that trader\u2019s tax return is due. It allowed the fraud to grow and continue in France.\n\nOnce we became aware of the carbon credit fraud in France, it was only a matter of time before it moved to the UK. These things are like the sea. They go across Europe in waves. So we were ready for when the fraud moved. On the day after the French introduced a measure that stopped the carousel, our officers went out and visited something like 30 or 40 traders and cancelled their VAT registration. That doesn\u2019t mean we stopped it. The UK lost about \u00a3250 million between May and July 2009, but I suspect we recovered at least half of that through insolvency law and tax law.\n\nCORRECTIV: From the UK, the carbon credit fraud then moved on to Germany where it was only stopped in July 2010. Was the German government not aware of the problem?\n\nStone: In 2009, every EU member state knew about the carbon fraud, certainly by July 2009. There were discussions on it in the Eurofisc and the Europol networks, and there were bilateral exchanges of information. It then became the responsibility of individual member states to take steps to stop it in their country.\n\nCORRECTIV: Why do some member states have so much more difficulty in combatting the fraud than others?\n\nStone: I worked with tax administration throughout Europe, and everybody at the workface was determined to stop the fraud. But they were hampered by the processes and the legislation. Most of it seemed to be antiquated and disjointed, quite frankly. They were unable to act in real time, they lacked the resources in terms of the number of staff with the skills, and it appeared that most EU member states had great difficulty in introducing new legislation.\n\nTake for example the \u2018abuse of rights\u2019 principle. It requires the tax administration to demonstrate that the businesses knew or should have known about the fraudulent schemes they were involved in. In the UK, this is an accepted principle. You argue that there is an abuse of the VAT system, and that\u2019s not what the system\u2019s set up for. The UK civil courts do not require that to be written into legislation. In France, there was a requirement for that same argument to be written into the tax code, and that takes time. [In in the UK] I didn\u2019t have to wait for it to go through parliament. As soon as I thought of that as a method of stopping the fraud, we could implement it the next day.\n\nCORRECTIV: Is there a way to stop this kind of fraud entirely?\n\nStone: The only thing that would probably stop it would be to have the same rate of tax throughout Europe on the same commodities. And that wouldn\u2019t be accepted nationally by each individual member state. I suppose that if you end up with a federal Europe, where Brussels has the central European bank and then decides what money is going to be divided up to each individual country and organizes all the collection of the taxes, that would work. But many countries don\u2019t want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\nRod Stone in the interview with CORRECTIV-reporter Marta Orosz \u00a9 Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: The EU Commission has proposed a new VAT tax scheme, the so-called definitive VAT system. Under the new rules, commodities traded between member states would be taxed in the country where they were sold, and the tax administrations would transfer the taxes between each other. Would that at least reduce the fraud?\n\nStone: Not really. Again, you go back to different tax rates on different goods [as the basis of] carousel fraud. I also know that it doesn\u2019t stop at cross-border trade in the EU. Let\u2019s assume the UK leaves the EU and we become a third country. We, and other countries within the EU, have suddenly introduced postponed accounting on imports from third countries. So what that basically means is that VAT is not collected at the border, it\u2019s going to be deferred. That means that missing trader fraud can start up with countries outside the European Union. So you will get the fraud still operating, potentially, from EU member states to the UK, back into the EU member states. In an effort to ease the burden on business, they\u2019ve actually created other opportunities for carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: You are saying that the door for fraud will always remain open?\n\nStone: Yes. All you can do is deter people from becoming involved. If people are going to be locked up for 15, 16 years and lose all their revenue, they soon stop doing it. So, to my mind, strengthening the ability to collect the money at the earliest opportunity, taking away the assets that the fraudsters have purchased with the money they\u2019ve stolen, and sending them to prison for a very long time, are the only deterrents that exists at the moment.\n\nCORRECTIV: So every member state should create this hostile environment?\n\nStone: There is a responsibility on the European tax directorate to encourage member states to do so and change their legislation. But you\u2019re coming up against cultural barriers. Countries will say, \u201dBut we\u2019ve done it this way for the last hundred years. This is the way our taxpayers expect it to be.\u201d You have to re-educate the taxpayers and say \u201dthe legislation that\u2019s been introduced isn\u2019t targeted at you, the taxpayer, it\u2019s targeted at organized crime\u201d. So, again, it\u2019s all about re-education. You have to re-educate your taxpayers, so that they understand why things are changing, you have to re-educate the judiciary, you need politicians that will change the legislation.\n\nOne of the things the UK did was try to be more proactive to people who don\u2019t put in their tax returns or their VAT returns. We\u2019re now moving to making tax digital in the UK. People will have to start to use the tax digital. That in turn might highlight missing traders more quickly. But you only need to be a missing trader for a day to make \u00a310 million."}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/latest-stories/2020/03/10/wanted-influencer-young-right-wing/", "published": "2020-03-10T12:43:08", "title": "Wanted: Influencer, Young, Right-wing", "text": "von Marta Orosz\n\nRod Stone is one of the leading experts on VAT carousel fraud worldwide.

As a result, I developed something called the \u2018abusive right\u2019 principle, which allowed the customs service to disallow import tax claims with respect to people involved in carousel fraud. I was given about three months to see if I could come up with a civil law remedy. We first started using it in January 2006, and by June we had disallowed \u00a33.2 billion worth of import tax claims associated with carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: So that was it \u2013 stop the tax claims, and the fraud just stops?\n\nStone: Not quite. In the UK, we used a holistic strategy to combat the fraud. We had a tool box. We looked at all the ways of freezing money, because that also made the environment hostile for them. We would look at insolvency. With insolvency you would identify the missing trader, that\u2019s the importer, and raise a debt against him with the amount of tax that was due. The insolvency practitioner would then take over the running of the missing trader and seek to recover the missing money from everyone else in the \u2018supply chain\u2019. The supply chain, of course, was totally contrived and the only person who had any money was the person at the top, the exporter. So most of the insolvency practitioner\u2019s investigations would end up at that point and they would then seek to recover the money. They could also recover the money from the directors personally and they could use worldwide freezing orders to target bank accounts abroad, and that was quite a successful approach. We could obviously also use criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n\nCORRECTIV: How were they different in the UK?\n\nStone: The attraction of carousel fraud in most countries is that it doesn\u2019t carry the same penalties as drug trafficking or bank robbery. Criminals are looking at no more than five years in prison, and by half of that they\u2019ll be out. In the UK, we charge people or indict them with cheating the public revenue, and that carries a life prison sentence. In fact, the longest prison sentence that has been handed out has been 17 years, but it has been quite common for people to be sentenced to between 12 and 14 years for carousel fraud. And if they don\u2019t pay back the stolen money, they\u2019re brought back before the court, and their sentence is increased.\n\nCORRECTIV: How would you and your colleagues chase the fraudsters?\n\nStone: If I suspected that a company was involved in carousel fraud I could send in an officer the same day. That\u2019s part of our UK legislation and doesn\u2019t exist in many EU states. We would get all the sales and purchase records, and from those records we could see who they\u2019ve been buying from. If it\u2019s the first intermediary company above the missing trader, by going to that trader we will identify the missing trader. And at that point, we can go and visit the missing trader. Of course, there won\u2019t be anyone there. It\u2019s just a brass plate on an office block. But by establishing that it\u2019s not a legitimate trading company, we would cancel the VAT registration. We had officers out visiting traders on a daily basis.\n\nBut you knew that as soon as you took out one company and cancelled the VAT registration, within three or four days another company would be registered in its place and ready to go. So you had to continually monitor new company registrations, and who was behind them. We set up a system where every company we suspected of being involved in VAT carousel fraud was asked to clear the details of their suppliers and customers with a special unit in the tax administration. I would come to your office and say, \u201dI\u2019m instructing you to phone up this office, and tell them every time you\u2019re going to buy from someone new or sell to someone new.\u201d In that way, the tax administration built up a profile of all the companies that were involved \u2014 or probably involved \u2014 in carousel fraud.\n\nIn addition, if a VAT refund claim was submitted,it was submitted on a monthly basis, and those refund claims would be selected for verification. A verification meant that every transaction on which VAT was being claimed would be tracked down to the missing trader, and nobody got any money until we were satisfied that it wasn\u2019t part of a missing trader scheme.\n\nI have to say there were a lot of legal challenges and we had to go to court frequently to hold our ground, and the courts again were very supportive, because they were aware of the problem, they were aware of the complexities of the fraud and that the tax administration was putting a lot of resources into stopping illegal or illegitimate business without impacting on honest traders.\n\nTax administration HMRC in London. \u00a9 Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: Why don\u2019t other EU member states act the same way?\n\nStone: The problem is that some of the legislation that countries are using is antiquated. It\u2019s designed to deal with tax evaders, perhaps a man on the street corner who evades a small amount of tax, and the law has never been updated to deal with organized crime. Most of Europe hasn\u2019t kept up with the times. You have to put it through parliament, you have to get people to agree, and many European countries seem to have great difficulty in getting this process through.\n\nLikewise, the courts have to understand what they\u2019re dealing with. In our early prosecutions and our early civil cases, a lot of the judges had difficulty in understanding the issue. We actually had to devise a strategy for delivering the trial to the court case so that everybody understood how the fraud worked. We tried to simplify it. There were large tax companies that were trying to sell VAT carousel fraud as a tax avoidance scheme. Which of course it wasn\u2019t. The tax authorities contacted all the large accountancy firms and re-educated them into what they were dealing with.\n\nCORRECTIV: How can we imagine the prosecution process?\n\nStone: From the time you first become suspicious of the fraud to the date of conviction, you\u2019re looking at between three and five years. In the UK, we have an exemplary prosecution process or strategy. We would only prosecute the cases that had the biggest impact. Some of the major fraud chains were never prosecuted. But they lost their money because we used civil law strategies. There\u2019s only a limited number of investigators. When you conduct a raid and arrest everybody, you need 250 or 500 officers. So there is a big resource implication.\n\nThe prosecution \u2013 criminal law \u2014 strategy meant that the tax administration had a say in which ones it wanted to prosecute. Some EU member states insist that every identified case of carousel fraud is forwarded to the prosecutor. For that reason, the cases that have been investigated and prosecuted in some EU member countries are more than 10 years old before they come to the court. In the UK we didn\u2019t want stale cases. You probably won\u2019t get much money out of it and it doesn\u2019t send a message to the people currently involved in the fraud. You want to try and do it in real time. As much in real time as you can.\n\nAfter the UK introduced its strategy, the fraudsters looked at other countries in the EU. The VAT carousel fraud became so minimal in comparison with what it had been that we were able to move on to other things. That was until 2009, when the fraudsters moved into the carbon credit market.\n\nCORRECTIV: What happened?\n\nStone: The fraudsters started forming companies in France, and in the last quarter of 2007 they started trading large amounts of carbon credits through the BlueNext exchange in Paris. In January 2009, we became aware of a particular company in the UK selling tens of millions of euros of carbon credits to companies in France. We notified our French colleagues of the trader in France who received the carbon credits. We know from the audit that was carried out by the French audit office that the information wasn\u2019t acted on. In fact, I don\u2019t think the French visited the missing trader for about 5 months. This was largely because French legislation didn\u2019t allow the tax administration to make a visit to a trader until after that trader\u2019s tax return is due. It allowed the fraud to grow and continue in France.\n\nOnce we became aware of the carbon credit fraud in France, it was only a matter of time before it moved to the UK. These things are like the sea. They go across Europe in waves. So we were ready for when the fraud moved. On the day after the French introduced a measure that stopped the carousel, our officers went out and visited something like 30 or 40 traders and cancelled their VAT registration. That doesn\u2019t mean we stopped it. The UK lost about \u00a3250 million between May and July 2009, but I suspect we recovered at least half of that through insolvency law and tax law.\n\nCORRECTIV: From the UK, the carbon credit fraud then moved on to Germany where it was only stopped in July 2010. Was the German government not aware of the problem?\n\nStone: In 2009, every EU member state knew about the carbon fraud, certainly by July 2009. There were discussions on it in the Eurofisc and the Europol networks, and there were bilateral exchanges of information. It then became the responsibility of individual member states to take steps to stop it in their country.\n\nCORRECTIV: Why do some member states have so much more difficulty in combatting the fraud than others?\n\nStone: I worked with tax administration throughout Europe, and everybody at the workface was determined to stop the fraud. But they were hampered by the processes and the legislation. Most of it seemed to be antiquated and disjointed, quite frankly. They were unable to act in real time, they lacked the resources in terms of the number of staff with the skills, and it appeared that most EU member states had great difficulty in introducing new legislation.\n\nTake for example the \u2018abuse of rights\u2019 principle. It requires the tax administration to demonstrate that the businesses knew or should have known about the fraudulent schemes they were involved in. In the UK, this is an accepted principle. You argue that there is an abuse of the VAT system, and that\u2019s not what the system\u2019s set up for. The UK civil courts do not require that to be written into legislation. In France, there was a requirement for that same argument to be written into the tax code, and that takes time. [In in the UK] I didn\u2019t have to wait for it to go through parliament. As soon as I thought of that as a method of stopping the fraud, we could implement it the next day.\n\nCORRECTIV: Is there a way to stop this kind of fraud entirely?\n\nStone: The only thing that would probably stop it would be to have the same rate of tax throughout Europe on the same commodities. And that wouldn\u2019t be accepted nationally by each individual member state. I suppose that if you end up with a federal Europe, where Brussels has the central European bank and then decides what money is going to be divided up to each individual country and organizes all the collection of the taxes, that would work. But many countries don\u2019t want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\nRod Stone in the interview with CORRECTIV-reporter Marta Orosz \u00a9 Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: The EU Commission has proposed a new VAT tax scheme, the so-called definitive VAT system. Under the new rules, commodities traded between member states would be taxed in the country where they were sold, and the tax administrations would transfer the taxes between each other. Would that at least reduce the fraud?\n\nStone: Not really. Again, you go back to different tax rates on different goods [as the basis of] carousel fraud. I also know that it doesn\u2019t stop at cross-border trade in the EU. Let\u2019s assume the UK leaves the EU and we become a third country. We, and other countries within the EU, have suddenly introduced postponed accounting on imports from third countries. So what that basically means is that VAT is not collected at the border, it\u2019s going to be deferred. That means that missing trader fraud can start up with countries outside the European Union. So you will get the fraud still operating, potentially, from EU member states to the UK, back into the EU member states. In an effort to ease the burden on business, they\u2019ve actually created other opportunities for carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: You are saying that the door for fraud will always remain open?\n\nStone: Yes. All you can do is deter people from becoming involved. If people are going to be locked up for 15, 16 years and lose all their revenue, they soon stop doing it. So, to my mind, strengthening the ability to collect the money at the earliest opportunity, taking away the assets that the fraudsters have purchased with the money they\u2019ve stolen, and sending them to prison for a very long time, are the only deterrents that exists at the moment.\n\nCORRECTIV: So every member state should create this hostile environment?\n\nStone: There is a responsibility on the European tax directorate to encourage member states to do so and change their legislation. But you\u2019re coming up against cultural barriers. Countries will say, \u201dBut we\u2019ve done it this way for the last hundred years. This is the way our taxpayers expect it to be.\u201d You have to re-educate the taxpayers and say \u201dthe legislation that\u2019s been introduced isn\u2019t targeted at you, the taxpayer, it\u2019s targeted at organized crime\u201d. So, again, it\u2019s all about re-education. You have to re-educate your taxpayers, so that they understand why things are changing, you have to re-educate the judiciary, you need politicians that will change the legislation.\n\nOne of the things the UK did was try to be more proactive to people who don\u2019t put in their tax returns or their VAT returns. We\u2019re now moving to making tax digital in the UK. People will have to start to use the tax digital. That in turn might highlight missing traders more quickly. But you only need to be a missing trader for a day to make \u00a310 million."}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/top-stories-en/2020/02/26/ratzinger-and-the-pedophile-priest/", "published": "2020-02-26T09:01:33", "title": "Ratzinger and the Pedophile Priest", "text": "In September 2018, an article was published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung which referenced an instance of abuse in Garching. No location and nor names are indicated in the article. However, it describes a case in which the priest in question allegedly abused a 14-year-old boy during confession. At the time, the child\u2019s father noticed how his son began repeatedly destroying the genital areas of plush toys. But the Church didn\u2019t believe the father or his son. According to the FAZ article, the child received psychological treatment. The FAZ writes that the priest and the Church denied the allegation.\n\nBut one Garching resident backed the family\u2019s claims. He was acquainted with the father. Another resident told CORRECTIV that he attended group therapy for people who had been abused with the boy. He said that in one session, the boy, today an adult man, collapsed. Several attempts by CORRECTIV to contact the boy were left unanswered. A spokesperson for diocese of Munich confirmed the instance to CORRECTIV and Frontal21: \u201cThe Archiepiscopal Ordinariate of Munich took the traumatization of those affected very seriously and provided financial aid.\u201d The diocese did not comment on the fact that the Church court did not believe the man abused.\n\nAltogether, information from diocese contacted throughout this investigation show that there were \u201cthree victims who had concrete accusations\u201d in Garching: One instance that lasted from 1987 to 1993, one in 1994 and another in 1996. Two of the confirmed cases happened concurrent with Auxiliary Bishop von Soden-Fraunhofen\u2019s time as H.\u2019s supervisor, when he repeatedly reported that everything was fine. The diocese wrote that all three cases were closed by the public prosecutor\u2019s office due to the statute of limitations, but that it made payments to the families in two.\n\nPriest Peter H.\u2019s child abuse has not been legally proven in Garching. But the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Munich II is looking into the allegations again and checking \u201cwhether there are further acts and whether investigations are to be started,\u201d according to a statement submitted to CORRECTIV.\n\nInsinuations or complaints remain barred by the statute of limitations, and people are still suffering because nobody believes them. However, reports from Essen, Garching, Munich and Grafing show clearly how Priest Peter H. took advantage of young boys: how he created opportunities for himself and abused his power. H. could contribute to the clarification. But he keeps silent.\n\nIn 2018, following emerging scandals, the Catholic Church released an internal study of instances of pastoral abuse. The case of H. is not the only one that shook the German Church. They had documented instances of sexual abuse in Berlin at Canisius College; in Bonn at the Aloisius College; in Aachen at a Benedictine abbey. They also recognized sexual abuse in Ettal and in the choir at the Cathedral of Regensburg. The news of systematic abuse in institutions of the Church came in fast. Cardinal Marx and the German Bishops\u2019 Conference knew they had to act and agreed to have all cases of sexual abuse in Germany after WWII investigated by an independent commission. The study was then presented in Fulda, in Hessen. The names of the victims and of the perpetrators were kept anonymous, but the sheer dimension was devastating. Over 70 years, 1,670 priests and members of the clergy were alleged of sexual abuse. There were 3,677 people who had been abused. Cynically, the study notes that, on average, there were only 2.5 victims for every accused priest. But that\u2019s only the number of cases that had been reported \u2013 the true figure may be much higher. A pedophile who is protected by the Church is unlikely to stop after just two or three abuses. The case of Peter H. shows that number of children abused by a single priest can be greater than 10 times that estimate.\n\nIndeed, the findings of this investigation show that it is likely that H. began abusing children earlier than is known and that more boys than assumed are his victims."}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/top-stories-en/2020/02/11/the-heartland-lobby/", "published": "2020-02-11T09:18:33", "title": "The Heartland Lobby", "text": "Finally, Mathias asks Taylor for a private meeting. This is the moment we have been working for over the past few weeks. Taylor sits relaxed in the armchair, his white shirt unbuttoned at the top, with a glass of red wine in his hand.\n\nBusiness talk.\n\nFrom the start, Mathias directs the conversation towards the possibility of donating to groups that deny climate change anonymously. His client, he says, is interested in a long-term investment \u2014 but requires that under no circumstances can he be linked to the transactions.\n\nIf the donor does not want to be named, there are some groups in the US, Taylor says. \u201cOne is Donors Trust.\u201d You can tell them which group the money should go to \u2013 Donors Trust will then channel the funds.\n\nDonors Trust\u2019s activities are not illegal, but they do bypass the otherwise quite extensive transparency regulations in the US. Both Donors Trust and Donors Capital Trust are tax-exempt foundations that redistribute corporate donations to conservative and market-liberal think tanks. US tax law requires them to disclose to whom the funds are given. However, they are allowed to keep the name of the donor undisclosed on the grounds of anonymous. In practice, this means oil and coal companies can support anti-climate campaigns via Donors Trust or Donors Capital without having to reveal their financial support.\n\nIn the past, big players in the fossil industry like Exxon Mobil and Koch brothers were among Heartland\u2019s major donors \u2014 but they withdrew public support a few years ago. We checked this by looking at tax returns, which are largely public in the US.\n\nNow, Donors Trust is now one of the association\u2019s biggest donors. The American magazine \u201cMother Jones\u201d described Donors Trust in 2013 as a \u201cBlack Box ATM\u201d. You could say that the foundation lends its name to the actual donors. Taylor confirmed this during the conversation.\n\nDonors Trust is now directing between two thirds and three quarters of its budget to Heartland to support its climate-skeptical positions, says Taylor. He sells this as his personal doing.\n\nSoon after, Taylor starts to speak about the German YouTuber sitting at the table a few meters away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to bring her on board,\u201d says Taylor, pointing in her direction.\n\nMathias asks: \u201cThe young lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo do some videos for us. Presenting to young people.\u201d\n\nThe young influencer is to start forming new groups. She should be a dropout from mainstream society, with whom as many as young people as possible should identify. According to a Facebook post by the Rhineland-Palatinate Association of \u201cJunge Alternative\u201d (Young Alternative), she is a member of the AfD\u2019s youth organization. The AfD and its members regularly distribute her videos. Taylor says the fight against climate protection measures needs a better image, to move away from old white men and instead showcase a younger generation. The YouTuber is going be the new face of the movement. She is Taylor\u2019s media strategy for the masses.\n\nTaylor also knows how to reach those who are not on YouTube but do vote in parliament. For a long time, he published a monthly brochure that the Heartland Institute sent to politicians.\n\nHe says it was specifically written \u201cWe do it as if it were for The New York Times or any other leftist newspaper.\u201d\n\nHe explains that the rule for their editors is to write it as if they were news stories. They cannot write anything that looks like it is opinion. \u201cYou present our angle on it, but you do it by who you decide to quote\u201d, he says\u201d.\n\nTaylor\u2019s team uses supposedly journalistic standards to raise doubts about human-induced climate change. What he is not interested is rigor and balance.\n\nAnd he succeeds at that, or at least that\u2019s what he says. There are people who will realise it is Heartland how is writing these articles, he explains, but others feel it is something they could use, and this is how they get to them.\n\nTaylor repeatedly emphasizes the good work done by EIKE. He says it is amazing what they can do in a year with such a small budget, and claims that the organization has 200,000 euros available. They help each other, he says, by participating in each other\u2019s conferences. Heartland also gave EIKE a small sum of money for the Munich conference in late November. When asked about EIKE\u2019s budget, the organization\u2019s representatives said that their \u201cdonation volume\u201d per year is \u201csignificantly below the stated amount\u201d.\n\nBut whenever Mathias steers the conversation toward our client\u2019s possible investment, Taylor brings his own institution into play \u2014 even though Mathias emphasizes several times that the client wants to donate to EIKE because he is mostly concerned about the European market.\n\n\u201cThen he tries to convince me to give my client\u2019s money directly to Heartland, instead of EIKE\u201c, Mathias recalls. Taylor politely adds that EIKE could, of course, use it much better in Europe. Then, a few seconds later, he talks about the benefits of Heartland establishing and disseminating specific information at the request of the client in exchange for money.\n\nA half hour has passed. Taylor and Mathias promise to stay in touch before returning to the other conference goers. Mathias writes down the conversation so he can jog his memory later.\n\nThis is far more than we had hoped for. Taylor has given us a deep insight into the business of climate change deniers. We now know about some of the strategies they use to disseminate disinformation.\n\nBut we want to have it in writing."}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/top-stories-en/2019/09/24/the-president-and-the-arms-dealer/", "published": "2019-09-24T16:17:47", "title": "The President and the Arms Dealer", "text": "For years, Abu-Dhabi-based Lebanese businessman Ahmad El Husseini acted as the German arms exporters\u2019 facilitator in the Middle East.

We actually had to devise a strategy for delivering the trial to the court case so that everybody understood how the fraud worked. We tried to simplify it. There were large tax companies that were trying to sell VAT carousel fraud as a tax avoidance scheme. Which of course it wasn\u2019t. The tax authorities contacted all the large accountancy firms and re-educated them into what they were dealing with.\n\nCORRECTIV: How can we imagine the prosecution process?\n\nStone: From the time you first become suspicious of the fraud to the date of conviction, you\u2019re looking at between three and five years. In the UK, we have an exemplary prosecution process or strategy. We would only prosecute the cases that had the biggest impact. Some of the major fraud chains were never prosecuted. But they lost their money because we used civil law strategies. There\u2019s only a limited number of investigators. When you conduct a raid and arrest everybody, you need 250 or 500 officers. So there is a big resource implication.\n\nThe prosecution \u2013 criminal law \u2014 strategy meant that the tax administration had a say in which ones it wanted to prosecute. Some EU member states insist that every identified case of carousel fraud is forwarded to the prosecutor. For that reason, the cases that have been investigated and prosecuted in some EU member countries are more than 10 years old before they come to the court. In the UK we didn\u2019t want stale cases. You probably won\u2019t get much money out of it and it doesn\u2019t send a message to the people currently involved in the fraud. You want to try and do it in real time. As much in real time as you can.\n\nAfter the UK introduced its strategy, the fraudsters looked at other countries in the EU. The VAT carousel fraud became so minimal in comparison with what it had been that we were able to move on to other things. That was until 2009, when the fraudsters moved into the carbon credit market.\n\nCORRECTIV: What happened?\n\nStone: The fraudsters started forming companies in France, and in the last quarter of 2007 they started trading large amounts of carbon credits through the BlueNext exchange in Paris. In January 2009, we became aware of a particular company in the UK selling tens of millions of euros of carbon credits to companies in France. We notified our French colleagues of the trader in France who received the carbon credits. We know from the audit that was carried out by the French audit office that the information wasn\u2019t acted on. In fact, I don\u2019t think the French visited the missing trader for about 5 months. This was largely because French legislation didn\u2019t allow the tax administration to make a visit to a trader until after that trader\u2019s tax return is due. It allowed the fraud to grow and continue in France.\n\nOnce we became aware of the carbon credit fraud in France, it was only a matter of time before it moved to the UK. These things are like the sea. They go across Europe in waves. So we were ready for when the fraud moved. On the day after the French introduced a measure that stopped the carousel, our officers went out and visited something like 30 or 40 traders and cancelled their VAT registration. That doesn\u2019t mean we stopped it. The UK lost about \u00a3250 million between May and July 2009, but I suspect we recovered at least half of that through insolvency law and tax law.\n\nCORRECTIV: From the UK, the carbon credit fraud then moved on to Germany where it was only stopped in July 2010. Was the German government not aware of the problem?\n\nStone: In 2009, every EU member state knew about the carbon fraud, certainly by July 2009. There were discussions on it in the Eurofisc and the Europol networks, and there were bilateral exchanges of information. It then became the responsibility of individual member states to take steps to stop it in their country.\n\nCORRECTIV: Why do some member states have so much more difficulty in combatting the fraud than others?\n\nStone: I worked with tax administration throughout Europe, and everybody at the workface was determined to stop the fraud. But they were hampered by the processes and the legislation. Most of it seemed to be antiquated and disjointed, quite frankly. They were unable to act in real time, they lacked the resources in terms of the number of staff with the skills, and it appeared that most EU member states had great difficulty in introducing new legislation.\n\nTake for example the \u2018abuse of rights\u2019 principle. It requires the tax administration to demonstrate that the businesses knew or should have known about the fraudulent schemes they were involved in. In the UK, this is an accepted principle. You argue that there is an abuse of the VAT system, and that\u2019s not what the system\u2019s set up for. The UK civil courts do not require that to be written into legislation. In France, there was a requirement for that same argument to be written into the tax code, and that takes time. [In in the UK] I didn\u2019t have to wait for it to go through parliament. As soon as I thought of that as a method of stopping the fraud, we could implement it the next day.\n\nCORRECTIV: Is there a way to stop this kind of fraud entirely?\n\nStone: The only thing that would probably stop it would be to have the same rate of tax throughout Europe on the same commodities. And that wouldn\u2019t be accepted nationally by each individual member state. I suppose that if you end up with a federal Europe, where Brussels has the central European bank and then decides what money is going to be divided up to each individual country and organizes all the collection of the taxes, that would work. But many countries don\u2019t want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\nRod Stone in the interview with CORRECTIV-reporter Marta Orosz \u00a9 Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: The EU Commission has proposed a new VAT tax scheme, the so-called definitive VAT system. Under the new rules, commodities traded between member states would be taxed in the country where they were sold, and the tax administrations would transfer the taxes between each other. Would that at least reduce the fraud?\n\nStone: Not really. Again, you go back to different tax rates on different goods [as the basis of] carousel fraud. I also know that it doesn\u2019t stop at cross-border trade in the EU. Let\u2019s assume the UK leaves the EU and we become a third country. We, and other countries within the EU, have suddenly introduced postponed accounting on imports from third countries. So what that basically means is that VAT is not collected at the border, it\u2019s going to be deferred. That means that missing trader fraud can start up with countries outside the European Union. So you will get the fraud still operating, potentially, from EU member states to the UK, back into the EU member states. In an effort to ease the burden on business, they\u2019ve actually created other opportunities for carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: You are saying that the door for fraud will always remain open?\n\nStone: Yes. All you can do is deter people from becoming involved. If people are going to be locked up for 15, 16 years and lose all their revenue, they soon stop doing it. So, to my mind, strengthening the ability to collect the money at the earliest opportunity, taking away the assets that the fraudsters have purchased with the money they\u2019ve stolen, and sending them to prison for a very long time, are the only deterrents that exists at the moment.\n\nCORRECTIV: So every member state should create this hostile environment?\n\nStone: There is a responsibility on the European tax directorate to encourage member states to do so and change their legislation. But you\u2019re coming up against cultural barriers. Countries will say, \u201dBut we\u2019ve done it this way for the last hundred years. This is the way our taxpayers expect it to be.\u201d You have to re-educate the taxpayers and say \u201dthe legislation that\u2019s been introduced isn\u2019t targeted at you, the taxpayer, it\u2019s targeted at organized crime\u201d. So, again, it\u2019s all about re-education. You have to re-educate your taxpayers, so that they understand why things are changing, you have to re-educate the judiciary, you need politicians that will change the legislation.\n\nOne of the things the UK did was try to be more proactive to people who don\u2019t put in their tax returns or their VAT returns. We\u2019re now moving to making tax digital in the UK. People will have to start to use the tax digital. That in turn might highlight missing traders more quickly. But you only need to be a missing trader for a day to make \u00a310 million."}, {"link": "https://correctiv.org/en/latest-stories/grand-theft-europe-en/2019/05/13/how-the-uk-is-combating-vat-fraud/", "published": "2019-05-13T15:25:36", "title": "How the UK is combating VAT fraud", "text": "von Marta Orosz\n\nRod Stone is one of the leading experts on VAT carousel fraud worldwide. For 40 years, he battled fraud at the HMRC, the UK\u2019s tax administration, and developed a comprehensive counter strategy. In 2015, he formed his own crime advisory company.\n\nCORRECTIV: The UK managed to reduce the annual loss to the treasury through VAT carousels from \u00a33 billion (\u20ac3.4 billion) to roughly \u00a3500 million. How was that possible?\n\nStone: In 2005, a number of VAT fraud prosecutions by the tax authorities failed. As a result, I developed something called the \u2018abusive right\u2019 principle, which allowed the customs service to disallow import tax claims with respect to people involved in carousel fraud. I was given about three months to see if I could come up with a civil law remedy. We first started using it in January 2006, and by June we had disallowed \u00a33.2 billion worth of import tax claims associated with carousel fraud.\n\nCORRECTIV: So that was it \u2013 stop the tax claims, and the fraud just stops?\n\nStone: Not quite. In the UK, we used a holistic strategy to combat the fraud. We had a tool box. We looked at all the ways of freezing money, because that also made the environment hostile for them. We would look at insolvency. With insolvency you would identify the missing trader, that\u2019s the importer, and raise a debt against him with the amount of tax that was due. The insolvency practitioner would then take over the running of the missing trader and seek to recover the missing money from everyone else in the \u2018supply chain\u2019. The supply chain, of course, was totally contrived and the only person who had any money was the person at the top, the exporter. So most of the insolvency practitioner\u2019s investigations would end up at that point and they would then seek to recover the money. They could also recover the money from the directors personally and they could use worldwide freezing orders to target bank accounts abroad, and that was quite a successful approach. We could obviously also use criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n\nCORRECTIV: How were they different in the UK?\n\nStone: The attraction of carousel fraud in most countries is that it doesn\u2019t carry the same penalties as drug trafficking or bank robbery. Criminals are looking at no more than five years in prison, and by half of that they\u2019ll be out. In the UK, we charge people or indict them with cheating the public revenue, and that carries a life prison sentence. In fact, the longest prison sentence that has been handed out has been 17 years, but it has been quite common for people to be sentenced to between 12 and 14 years for carousel fraud. And if they don\u2019t pay back the stolen money, they\u2019re brought back before the court, and their sentence is increased.\n\nCORRECTIV: How would you and your colleagues chase the fraudsters?\n\nStone: If I suspected that a company was involved in carousel fraud I could send in an officer the same day. That\u2019s part of our UK legislation and doesn\u2019t exist in many EU states. We would get all the sales and purchase records, and from those records we could see who they\u2019ve been buying from. If it\u2019s the first intermediary company above the missing trader, by going to that trader we will identify the missing trader. And at that point, we can go and visit the missing trader. Of course, there won\u2019t be anyone there. It\u2019s just a brass plate on an office block. But by establishing that it\u2019s not a legitimate trading company, we would cancel the VAT registration. We had officers out visiting traders on a daily basis.\n\nBut you knew that as soon as you took out one company and cancelled the VAT registration, within three or four days another company would be registered in its place and ready to go. So you had to continually monitor new company registrations, and who was behind them. We set up a system where every company we suspected of being involved in VAT carousel fraud was asked to clear the details of their suppliers and customers with a special unit in the tax administration. I would come to your office and say, \u201dI\u2019m instructing you to phone up this office, and tell them every time you\u2019re going to buy from someone new or sell to someone new.\u201d In that way, the tax administration built up a profile of all the companies that were involved \u2014 or probably involved \u2014 in carousel fraud.\n\nIn addition, if a VAT refund claim was submitted,it was submitted on a monthly basis, and those refund claims would be selected for verification. A verification meant that every transaction on which VAT was being claimed would be tracked down to the missing trader, and nobody got any money until we were satisfied that it wasn\u2019t part of a missing trader scheme.\n\nI have to say there were a lot of legal challenges and we had to go to court frequently to hold our ground, and the courts again were very supportive, because they were aware of the problem, they were aware of the complexities of the fraud and that the tax administration was putting a lot of resources into stopping illegal or illegitimate business without impacting on honest traders.\n\nTax administration HMRC in London. \u00a9 Ivo Mayr\n\nCORRECTIV: Why don\u2019t other EU member states act the same way?\n\nStone: The problem is that some of the legislation that countries are using is antiquated. It\u2019s designed to deal with tax evaders, perhaps a man on the street corner who evades a small amount of tax, and the law has never been updated to deal with organized crime. Most of Europe hasn\u2019t kept up with the times. You have to put it through parliament, you have to get people to agree, and many European countries seem to have great difficulty in getting this process through.\n\nLikewise, the courts have to understand what they\u2019re dealing with.

Following his tracks reveals the structure of the fraud system and the difficulties the authorities face in the war against VAT fraud.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize why it\u2019s so much cheaper to buy mobile phones on eBay rather than from the manufacturer direct. But not Amir Baha (name changed) who understood perfectly when as a 16-year-old schoolboy he started selling mobiles in a city in Germany\u2019s North Rhine Westphalia. \u201cAll around the world people know: if you want to sell mobiles in Germany, they have to come from fraud. Otherwise there\u2019s no money in it.\u201d That\u2019s how he summed it up nearly a decade later to prosecutors in Cologne.\n\nBaha was a smart kid who rose to be a multi-millionaire in the space of a few short years. He was at home at Dubai\u2019s nightclubs and flew first class. He traded mobile phones, game consoles, copper electrodes and even certificates for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. At the time of his arrest, he was running eleven companies registered in other people\u2019s names.\n\nHe did not, however, earn his money from mark-ups on these products but from the tax he stole. By moving his merchandise in circles across borders and without paying value-added tax (VAT), he siphoned off millions from state coffers, tricking the authorities into paying him and his partners money they weren\u2019t owed. Opinions differ as to how much exactly. Insiders estimate \u20ac110 million, one prosecutor puts the number at \u20ac60 million, a court verdict against Baha at \u20ac40 million.\n\nIn any case, a huge amount for somebody who traded in mobile phones. An employee with an above-average salary of \u20ac5,000 per month would have to work 1,600 years to earn \u20ac100 million. In his crowd, however, Baha was only a medium-sized player.\n\nThis kind of crime, dubbed \u2018VAT carousels\u2019 or Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud, is costing Germany from \u20ac5 billion at the low end of estimates to anything up to \u20ac14 billion annually. As Europe\u2019s largest economy, the losses are higher than elsewhere. But VAT fraud carousels are an EU-wide problem with the EU commission fixing the total annual tax loss at around \u20ac50 billion.\n\nIn October last year, CORRECTIV published its investigation into the highly complex share deals known as Cum-Ex, which are designed to \u2018reclaim\u2019 tax that was never in fact paid. The Cum-Ex operators require the assistance of teams of highly sophisticated lawyers and bankers to help engineer the trades. By contrast, VAT fraud, some reckon, is Cum-Ex for the masses.\n\nEven teenagers such as Baha can advance from small-time mobile phone seller to multi-millionaire within a couple of years. For the public, the result is the same: billions of tax money ends up in criminals\u2019 pockets rather than going into hospitals, schools and law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWhy people would do any other form of criminality, I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Rod Stone, a former British tax investigator and one of Europe\u2019s leading authorities on the subject. \u201cWhy do drugs, why do anything else when they can make so much money out of this?\u201d Stone also questions why hardly any European countries are taking the problem seriously despite the enormous losses.

It claims Floyd\u2019s family \u201cdoes not fall into the listed criteria of eligible recipients.\u201d\n\nThere are indeed criteria for those eligible to receive burial flags from Veterans Affairs; the flags are provided at no cost for the funeral of veterans and typically are given to the next-of-kin as a keepsake afterward.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing that precludes Pelosi, or any other American citizen, from gifting a flag \u2014 or folding it.\n\n\u201cThere are no prescriptive rules saying you can\u2019t give a flag to anyone,\u201d said Scot Guenter, senior director of the Flag Research Center and professor emeritus of American Studies at San Jose State University. \u201cThe whole point of the American flag is that we don\u2019t live in a society that says you can\u2019t use the flag.\u201d\n\nGuenter, who wrote the book, \u201cThe American Flag, 1777-1924: Cultural Shifts from Creation to Codification,\u201d also told us in a phone interview that folding a flag is a sign of respect for it.\n\nThere is also no mention in the U.S. \u201cFlag Code,\u201d whose provisions Guenter said are \u201crules of etiquette,\u201d of who is allowed to gift a flag.\n\n\u201cWhile the Department of Veterans Affairs provides a casket flag for all honorable veterans and the military service provides them for active-duty service members upon their death, the U.S. Flag Code does not prohibit or limit a flag draping the coffin to any specific group,\u201d John Raughter, a spokesman for the American Legion, a veterans association, told us in an email. \u201cTraditionally though, as the flag is provided for veterans and active-duty service members, it has come to represent a veteran funeral rite.\u201d\n\nRaughter added that \u201cthere is no rule about who may receive a flag as a gift. We encourage the display of the flag of the United States by all citizens of the United States. Now while there is no rule for it, traditionally a flag is folded into a triangle when it is not flown and may be stored in a presentation case if a particular flag has special meaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo presenting someone with a flag, folded into a triangle and placed into a display case is an honorable way of presenting and maintaining the flag of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nFlags that are flown over the Capitol \u2014 as was the case with the one given to Philonise Floyd \u2014 are, in fact, routinely requested by the offices of members of Congress through the Capitol Flag Program, which started in the 1930s.\n\nThe program, under the Architect of the Capitol, allows members of the public to purchase such flags through House and Senate offices; many members of Congress have instructions on their websites for ordering a flag for any occasion. The Architect of the Capitol \u201cfulfills on average more than 100,000 flag requests from Members of Congress annually, with the number of requests and the popularity of the Capitol Flag Program growing steadily each year,\u201d according to the program\u2019s website.\n\nAnd, according to the House Members\u2019 Congressional Handbook, members can use such flags as official gifts.\n\n\u201cU.S. flags flown over the Capitol for official presentation as a gift, including the flag flying fee, are reimbursable,\u201d the handbook says. \u201cSuch flags must be for the personal use of or display by the recipient (examples may include, but are not limited to: flags presented at a building dedication for which the Member secured official funding, a flag presented to the family of a fallen soldier, flags presented for exceptional public distinction, etc,).\u201d\n\nSo nothing in the handbook, either, limits members\u2019 gifting of flags flown over the Capitol only to military families.\n\nIn December 2016, former Rep. Dennis Ross, a Republican from Florida, gave a folded, framed flag that had flown over the Capitol to a new school in Davenport, Florida. And the next year, Republican Rep. Roger Williams of Texas gifted two folded, encased flags from the Capitol to two new schools in his district.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

The FDA\u2019s action does the opposite.\n\nFollowing Azar\u2019s lead, President Donald Trump also falsely accused a journalist of asking a \u201cvery inaccurately stated question\u201d about the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization, or EUA, and continued to point to unscientific anecdotal evidence to insist that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, despite growing evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe FDA announced on June 15 that it had revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine because the drugs are \u201cunlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,\u201d and that the \u201cknown and potential benefits\u201d of the drugs \u201cno longer outweigh\u201d the risks \u2014 which can include \u201cserious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.\u201d\n\nThe FDA had issued the EUA back in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile \u201cwhen clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.\u201d\n\nBut accumulating evidence, including a large randomized controlled trial that the agency cited in its decision, has found that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Other trials also indicate that the drug does not prevent the disease if given shortly after exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nThe political spin began at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House when a journalist asked Trump to respond to news of the FDA\u2019s revocation. The reporter paraphrased the agency as saying the drugs were \u201cno longer considered reasonable as a useful treatment for COVID.\u201d\n\nTrump has misleadingly promoted hydroxychloroquine as a potential \u201cgame changer,\u201d despite its health risks and unproven use as a COVID-19 treatment.\n\nAzar said that the reporter\u2019s question was not \u201cquite accurate\u201d because the FDA\u2019s finding only applied to hospitalized patients. He then proceeded to suggest that revoking the EUA was a good thing because it removes a \u201csignificant misunderstanding\u201d that the drug could only be used in a hospital setting.\n\nThe secretary stressed that the drug can still be prescribed for off-label use to treat COVID-19, saying the FDA\u2019s decision \u201cactually removes a potential barrier to that.\u201d\n\nAzar, June 15: At this point, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are just like any other approved drug in the United States. They may be used in hospital, they may be used in out-patient, they may be used at home \u2014 all subject to a doctor\u2019s prescription. In fact, the FDA\u2019s removal of the emergency use authorization takes away what had been a significant misunderstanding by many that had made people think that somehow it could only be used in a hospital setting. And we\u2019ve tried to make that clear throughout. It\u2019s a drug. It\u2019s approved in the United States. Has been for decades. If a doctor wishes to prescribe it, working with a patient, they may prescribe it for any purpose that they wish to do so. And this actually removes a potential barrier to that. Trump: So it actually un-complicates it \u2014 Azar: It does. Trump: \u2014 in a way. And I think that\u2019s probably \u2014 your question was a very inaccurately stated question. Reporter: No, I didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean to pose it inaccurately. I believe what it said specifically was that it\u2019s no longer reasonable to consider it an appropriate treatment. Azar: Only in the hospital. It said the data in the hospital setting was not supported. We continue to study in outpatient settings, as well as preventive. That data is not yet in.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the FDA\u2019s decision only pertains to hospitalized patients, the reporter\u2019s phrasing is very similar to that used in the agency\u2019s own revocation letter.\n\n\u201cFDA has concluded that, based on this new information and other information discussed in the attached memorandum, it is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,\u201d wrote FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton.\n\nRachel Sachs, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor, told us in a phone interview that the \u201creasonable\u201d language, which both the reporter and the FDA used, is part of the statute governing how the FDA can issue EUAs.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that the FDA has to find when it grants an EUA is that it\u2019s reasonable to believe that the drug in question is effective for the treatment of the condition,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so what the FDA is saying now is that based on the weight of the evidence, it\u2019s no longer reasonable to believe that hydroxychloroquine is effective for the treatment of COVID.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, the agency toggles between statements that are specific to hospitalized patients and others that are more general. For instance, the FDA says that upon a second review of the in vitro studies that first suggested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have an ability to combat the coronavirus, it now believes the suggested doses \u201care unlikely to produce an antiviral effect.\u201d\n\nIt also notes that the earlier studies that found the drugs might decrease the amount of virus patients shed \u201chave not been consistently replicated,\u201d and that a randomized controlled trial that more rigorously tested the idea found no difference between the proportion of those taking hydroxychloroquine and those getting the standard of care in testing negative for the virus.\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to national guidelines that now do not recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside of a clinical trial, including the National Institutes of Health guidelines, which recommend against the use of the drugs outside of a trial.\n\nSeveral experts expressed bafflement that Azar \u2014 and then Trump \u2014 would object to the reporter\u2019s question.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the FDA said,\u201d said Dr. Neil Schluger, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Columbia University who has studied hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. \u201cAzar\u2019s being very misleading in that statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the reporter\u2019s question was perfect,\u201d said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania with expertise in FDA regulation. \u201cIf Azar was doing his job as a public health official, he wouldn\u2019t have chided the reporter for how he asked the question.\u201d\n\nFDA Decision Doesn\u2019t Remove \u2018Potential Barrier\u2019\n\nPerhaps more critically, experts balked at Azar\u2019s suggestion that removing the EUA was lifting a \u201cpotential barrier\u201d on hydroxychloroquine\u2019s use, when in fact, the move reduces access to the drug by eliminating the option of getting it from the national stockpile.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s somehow implying that the EUA made people think you could only use this to treat COVID-19 for hospitalized patients, and now that they\u2019ve removed the EUA, you could use it to treat COVID patients anywhere,\u201d Schluger said of hydroxychloroquine in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the opposite of that.\u201d\n\nAzar is correct to say that because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are FDA-approved to treat other conditions, including malaria \u2014 and in the case of hydroxychloroquine, rheumatoid diseases \u2014 they can be prescribed to COVID-19 patients in what\u2019s called off-label prescribing.\n\nBut that has always been true. The EUA never changed that, and the revocation also does not change that.\n\n\u201cThe EUA had no impact on whether physicians could prescribe the drug off-label, whether patients could receive it off-label,\u201d said Sachs. \u201cIt just made it easier for hospital-based providers to obtain the drug from the stockpile and to administer it to their patients.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s useful to consider exactly what the initial EUA did in the first place. As Fernandez Lynch explained, the goal was to provide a supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile, based on the limited evidence at the time that the drugs might work against the coronavirus.\n\nWhile chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that can be prescribed off-label, the specific chloroquine tablets donated to the stockpile were not actually FDA-approved for any use. On top of that, interstate commerce laws prevent distribution of drugs for unapproved uses, which meant that both drugs could not be legally dispensed from the national stockpile for COVID-19.\n\nTo make that distribution legal, the FDA needed to issue an EUA, which the agency decided to limit to hospitalized patients outside of clinical trials.\n\nAzar\u2019s argument appears to be that that specification confused people, leading some to think that the drug more broadly could only be prescribed to hospitalized patients \u2014 and that by revoking the entire EUA, that restriction was lifted.\n\nBut Sachs said that line of thinking doesn\u2019t hold water.\n\n\u201cI certainly have no evidence to support the claim that people believed hydroxychloroquine was only available in the hospital setting, and that now a barrier to its use was removed,\u201d she said. \u201cSec. Azar\u2019s framing sounds like what the FDA is doing is opening up hydroxychloroquine for broader use. But that\u2019s actually not what\u2019s going on \u2014 they\u2019re actually restricting one avenue for its use by withdrawing the EUA.\u201d\n\nFernandez Lynch agreed, saying it was misleading for Azar to characterize the EUA revocation as a kind of easing on hydroxychloroquine.\n\n\u201cWhat they did was take away the EUA because the evidence no longer supported the EUA,\u201d she said in a phone interview, adding that it was irresponsible as a public health official not to relay the information that led the FDA to change its mind. \u201cInstead he went ahead and emphasized, do whatever you want under off-label prescribing \u2014 we\u2019re going to leave this up to you.\u201d\n\nContrary to Azar\u2019s suggestion that the FDA was making it easier to get chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outpatients, the agency already came forward in late April to caution against the use of both drugs outside of hospitals or a clinical trial.\n\nMisleading Research Summaries\n\nDuring the roundtable, Azar and Trump also gave misleading or incomplete descriptions of the evidence to date about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19.\n\nAs he has done in the past, the president \u2014 who has claimed to have taken hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 \u2014 said he has heard \u201csome great reports\u201d about the drugs and suggested without evidence that the hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine were going to die anyway.\n\nTrump, June 15: The only place we don\u2019t get necessarily reports are coming out of Alex\u2019s agency or wherever they come from. I don\u2019t understand that, Alex. What is it exactly? Because I have heard \u2014 I\u2019ve had so many people that were so thrilled with the results from hydroxy. So, what is that exactly? Azar: Well, at your direction, we continue to study, especially in earlier phase \u2014 so a lot of the data that has come out that was more negative was people who were quite ill in the hospital. Trump: People that were, like, seriously ill. Like, they weren\u2019t going to make it. \u201cLet\u2019s give them a little hydroxy.\u201d And then they don\u2019t make it. And they say, \u201cOh, wow, maybe the president was wrong.\u201d All I know is that we\u2019ve had some tremendous reports. I\u2019ve had a lot of people tell me that they think it saved their lives.\n\nAs Schluger previously told us, the majority of patients in several hydroxychloroquine studies survived, so it\u2019s not the case that hydroxychloroquine has only been given to deathly ill patients.\n\nIt is true, however, that nearly all of the studies have been done in hospitalized patients.\n\nThis includes a large randomized controlled trial in the U.K. called RECOVERY that the FDA cited in its EUA revocation decision. Although the full results have not been published, the trial reported on June 5 that hydroxychloroquine did not reduce the risk of death and also did not shorten the hospital stay or offer beneficial effects on other outcomes.\n\nAccording to a June 5 press release, 25.7% of the 1,542 hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine died after 28 days, whereas 23.5% of the 3,132 patients who were given usual care died \u2014 a difference that was not statistically significant.\n\nThe press release concluded that the results \u201cconvincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.\u201d\n\nFrom that data, plus other smaller randomized controlled trials and other rigorously performed observational studies, which we have previously reviewed, it does not appear hydroxychloroquine offers any benefit to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\n\u201cThe science is pretty straightforward on this,\u201d said Schluger. \u201cThe data tell a pretty consistent story.\u201d\n\nOn June 17, the World Health Organization announced that given the initial findings from its own trial, the results of the RECOVERY trial and a review of the evidence, it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity trial, which also was evaluating the drug in hospitalized patients.\n\nWhat is less clear \u2014 and where Trump and Azar may have a point \u2014 is that these results don\u2019t necessarily rule out that hydroxychloroquine might still have some effect in milder cases or for COVID-19 prevention.\n\nSome scientists do think it\u2019s plausible that hydroxychloroquine could still work in these instances \u2014 even if there isn\u2019t yet any evidence that it does.\n\nAs Nicholas White, a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford\u2019s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health and Mahidol University in Thailand, told us in an email, it\u2019s \u201c[m]uch easier to prevent infections growing in the body\u201d than to get \u201crid of them once they have grown.\u201d\n\nHe is helping to run a multinational randomized controlled trial with upwards of 40,000 participants to test whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine can prevent COVID-19 \u2014 and is concerned that some governmental decisions, including the FDA\u2019s memo, might make it harder to complete the trials that are necessary to definitively say whether the drugs work or not.\n\nThe WHO, notably, also cautioned that its suspension decision should not apply to trials testing hydroxychloroquine\u2019s ability to prevent COVID-19 either before or after exposure, or what is called pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nStill, Azar didn\u2019t give the whole story when he said that the \u201cdata is not yet in\u201d regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat people outside of the hospital or for COVID-19 prevention. While many of these trials are in the works, at least one has reported results \u2014 and it, too, failed to identify an effect.\n\nThe University of Minnesota published the first post-exposure prophylaxis randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3. In the double-blind trial, more than 800 volunteers were randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine or a placebo within four days of exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly 12% of hydroxychloroquine participants developed a COVID-19-like illness compared with 14.3% of those getting the placebo \u2014 a difference that was not significant.\n\nSome scientists argue that more data is needed. They have critiqued the study because it did not confirm COVID-19 infection in the vast majority of people who were exposed and went on to develop the disease \u2014 an unavoidable problem, given the lack of testing availability at the time. Others, meanwhile, have found the results largely convincing.\n\nSchluger called it a \u201cpretty good study,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s a pretty big study \u2014 821 patients \u2014 a randomized trial, so that\u2019s a very high standard of evidence.\u201d\n\nScience magazine reported on June 9 that another post-exposure prevention trial, run out of Barcelona, Spain, did not pick up a protective effect of hydroxychloroquine. The trial included more than 2,300 people who were exposed to the coronavirus and found there was no significant difference among those who received hydroxychloroquine versus the standard care in developing COVID-19. The study\u2019s lead investigator told Science that the results had been submitted for publication.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota infectious disease specialist Dr. David Boulware, who led the first published prophylaxis trial, said no studies have reported results yet for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Those studies typically involve high-risk health care workers and have been slower to enroll volunteers.\n\nBut he said the results of his university\u2019s trial of hydroxychloroquine in outpatients had been reported to the FDA.\n\n\u201cInvestigators from the University of Minnesota conducted a nationwide randomized clinical trial testing hydroxychloroquine for early outpatient treatment of COVID-19,\u201d he said in an email, adding that the drug was given within four days of the start of COVID-19 symptoms. \u201cThe trial\u2019s final results were shared with FDA on June 11, 2020 as well as with NIH, and the manuscript is presently undergoing scientific peer-review.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no positive data supporting hydroxychloroquine having a clinical benefit in humans with coronavirus,\u201d said Boulware in response to Azar\u2019s claim that a lot of the \u201cmore negative\u201d data was in very ill hospitalized patients. \u201cThe FDA is fully aware of what data do exist for earlier phase treatment.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

According to its website, the group\u2019s main goals are rebuilding infrastructure, creating a strong workforce, reforming trade agreements, cutting taxes and updating regulations to support the Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n\nAmerica First Policies is allied with America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC that spent $36.4 million in the 2018 cycle.\n\nSix of Trump\u2019s former campaign aides created America First Policies in January 2017. The group\u2019s founders include: Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager; David Bossie, Trump\u2019s 2016 deputy campaign manager; Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s former chief of staff; Marty Obst, who managed Pence\u2019s gubernatorial campaign in Indiana; and Katrina Pierson, a 2020 campaign adviser for Trump.\n\nRick Gates, Trump\u2019s other deputy campaign manager in 2016, also helped create the nonprofit. However, Gates was forced to leave the group in March 2017 because of his ties to Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman and chief strategist. As we have previously reported, both Manafort and Gates were indicted on charges of money laundering and tax evasion related to their work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.\n\nGates pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements to federal investigators. Manafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison after being found guilty in August 2018 on five tax fraud charges, one charge of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and two counts of bank fraud.\n\nThe America First Action super PAC affiliated with America First Policies is led by Linda McMahon, who previously served in Trump\u2019s cabinet as administrator of the Small Business Administration, and Brian O. Walsh, who, prior to joining America First Action, served as the president of the conservative outside groups American Action Network and the Congressional Leadership Fund.\n\nAmerica First Action raised $29 million in the 2018 election cycle and spent $29.3 million on independent expenditures, which are disbursements on communications advocating for or against particular candidates. Most of that, about $28 million, was spent trying to get Republicans elected to Congress. The organization spent more than $3 million opposing Democrat Colin Allred, who beat Republican Pete Sessions in Texas\u2019 32nd Congressional District and more than $2.8 million opposing Democrat Joe Donnelly, who lost to Mike Braun in Indiana\u2019s Senate race. The group also spent more than $289,000 in support of Arizona Republican Martha McSally, who lost her Senate race to Democrat Krysten Sinema.\n\nSo far in 2020, the America First Action super PAC has raised more than $40 million.

But it\u2019s simply wrong for Trump to claim the prior administration didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nThe Biden campaign disputed the claim. Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement that Trump \u201cknows that isn\u2019t true because he has spent the past three years tearing down the very reforms the Obama-Biden Administration pursued.\u201d Bedingfield pointed to three initiatives:\n\nThe Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which issued recommendations for police departments in a May 2015 report.\n\nThe use of consent decrees to get police departments to enact changes regarding constitutional rights violations.\n\nLimits on the transfer of military weapons to police departments.\n\nDavid Alan Sklansky, professor of law and faculty co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, told us those are exactly the three initiatives he would cite. \u201cAll three of those were significant steps taken to address problems with American policing including but not limited to the use of force and the issue of race in policing,\u201d he said.\n\nSklansky called Trump\u2019s claim \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cflat-out false.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indisputable that the Obama administration did far more to address this issue than the Trump administration,\u201d he said, adding that the Trump administration has tried to undo the progress the previous administration had made.\n\nSpecifically, the Trump administration limited the use of consent decrees and rolled back Obama\u2019s restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to local police departments.\n\nLauren-Brooke Eisen and Spencer P. Boyer, of the Brennan Center for Justice, also cited these three measures in a June 16 post titled \u201cWhat the Federal Government Can Do to Help Fix Policing in America.\u201d They included one more Obama-era effort: the Collaborative Reform Initiative in the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, which worked with local law enforcement to evaluate their operations, and recommend and institute changes. That program, too, ended under Trump.\n\nTask Force on 21st Century Policing\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2014, Obama signed an executive order to create the Task Force on 21st Century Policing \u201cto strengthen community policing and strengthen trust among law enforcement officers and the communities they serve,\u201d a White House fact sheet said.\n\nThe task force was formed after several violent police incidents involving African Americans, including the 2014 killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York and Tamir Rice in Cleveland. It was chaired by Charles Ramsey, then the commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department and president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and Laurie Robinson, a professor of criminology and law at George Mason University and a former Justice Department official.\n\nIn November and December 2014, grand juries decided not to indict the officers in the Brown and Garner cases. In discussing the task force at the time, Obama said Ferguson, where weeks of protests occurred, exposed \u201ca simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color.\u201d\n\nThe task force issued its final report in May 2015, offering recommendations on issues including building trust, community policing, officer training and officer safety. Sklansky told us the task force was \u201ca very extensive operation that culminated in a very detailed, very thoughtful report with a lot of specific recommendations, many of which had to do with police violence.\u201d\n\nRobinson, in a February article published in the ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, said the report \u201chad an impact.\u201d Several law enforcement groups \u201chave embraced the report,\u201d she said, and a think tank researcher said agencies across the country were using it \u201cas their playbook.\u201d\n\nThe Brennan Center experts noted that \u201cnot nearly enough jurisdictions have heeded the advice\u201d in that report.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting, as the Washington Post Fact Checker also did, that Trump\u2019s executive order reflected the task force recommendations on a few points.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order called for the attorney general and secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \u201cdevelop opportunities to train law enforcement officers with respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental health, homelessness, and addiction\u201d and \u201cto increase the capacity of social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies.\u201d The 2015 task force report recommended \u201cmultidisciplinary, community team approaches\u201d for \u201cresponding to mental health crisis situations\u201d as well as community problems involving \u201chomelessness, substance abuse, domestic violence, human trafficking, and child abuse.\u201d\n\nThe task force said law enforcement \u201cpolicies for training on use of force should emphasize de-escalation and alternatives to arrest or summons in situations where appropriate,\u201d while Trump\u2019s executive order said the administration shall propose legislation that would include \u201ctraining and technical assistance required to adopt and implement improved use-of-force policies and procedures, including scenario-driven de-escalation techniques.\u201d\n\nConsent Decrees\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s Department of Justice Civil Rights Division conducted \u201cpattern or practice\u201d investigations of police departments focused on whether there were patterns of constitutional rights violations, and then obtained court-enforced consent decrees to get some departments to implement changes.\n\nA Jan. 5, 2017, exit memo by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the DOJ launched 23 such investigations under Obama and \u201cis now enforcing 17 agreements with law enforcement agencies across the country, including 14 consent decrees.\u201d Those investigations focused on the Ferguson Police Department, as well as agencies in Baltimore, Chicago and other cities.\n\n\u201cConsent decrees were a very important initiative to try to bring systemic change to police departments,\u201d addressing all forms of policing including use of force, Sklansky said. The Obama administration \u201claunched more of these investigations than any previous administration.\u201d\n\nBut the Trump administration significantly scaled back that effort. Eisen and Boyer write that on the day he left office, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u201csigned a memo detailing the narrow circumstances under which DOJ can enter into a consent decree. Since President Trump took office, the Justice Department has publicly announced only one pattern-or-practice investigation into a police department.\u201d\n\nThe Nov. 7, 2018, memo said it \u201cprovides guidance on the limited circumstances in which such a consent decree may be appropriate; limits the terms for consent decrees and settlement agreements with state and local governmental entities\u201d and \u201camends the process for the approval of these mechanisms in cases in which they are permissible.\u201d\n\nSessions had criticized the Baltimore consent decree, an agreement reached near the end of the Obama administration but signed by a federal judge in April 2017. Sessions said he had \u201cgrave concerns that some provisions of this decree will reduce the lawful powers of the police department and result in a less safe city.\u201d\n\nMilitary Weapons\n\nObama also signed an executive order to create a working group to limit surplus military equipment and supplies that are provided for free to state and local law enforcement agencies under what\u2019s called the 1033 program.\n\nThe administration then adopted the recommendations of the working group, issued in May 2015, creating a \u201cprohibited equipment list\u201d \u2014 which included tracked armored vehicles, grenade launchers and firearms/ammunition of .50 caliber and above \u2014 and a \u201ccontrolled equipment list\u201d \u2014 including wheeled armored vehicles, riot shields and helmets, and explosives. Police departments could still obtain the equipment in the latter group, but they would have to provide justification for needing it and proper training.\n\nWe wrote about this issue in 2017 when Sessions misleadingly cited studies to claim Obama \u201cwent too far\u201d and undermined public safety.\n\nOn Aug. 28, 2017, Trump issued an executive order rescinding Obama\u2019s.\n\nOther Efforts\n\nIn addition, the Brennan Center experts wrote about the Trump administration\u2019s curtailing of the Collaborative Reform Initiative in the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, saying the program \u201chad widespread support from police chiefs across the country\u201d and allowed the DOJ to work with the cities and avoid litigation.\n\nSessions scaled back that program in September 2017, saying in a memo, \u201cThis is a course correction to ensure that resources go to agencies that require assistance rather than expensive wide-ranging investigative assessments that go beyond the scope of technical assistance and support.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the Washington Post reported that Sessions\u2019 decision would affect \u201cabout 14 police departments nationwide that had either begun receiving public reports from the COPS office or expected to receive such reports soon.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, the Obama DOJ also announced $23.2 million in grants to 73 local law enforcement agencies to \u201cexpand the use of body-worn cameras and explore their impact.\u201d\n\nIn her exit memo, Lynch also touted implicit bias training that the DOJ required of all employees and federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nClearly, Trump was wrong to claim Obama and Biden \u201cnever even tried to fix\u201d issues surrounding police brutality and lack of trust between police departments and the communities they serve. Trump may not agree with some of the measures \u2014 as evidenced by his eliminating or restricting them \u2014 but they were indeed efforts aimed directly at these issues.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

The money referenced was actually provided to a U.S. research group. Only $600,000 went to the lab as part of a U.S.-approved collaboration.\n\nFull Story\n\nA post circulating on Facebook is spreading a debunked falsehood about U.S. funding that went to a lab in Wuhan, China \u2014 the city where the outbreak of the novel coronavirus began \u2014 as well as a false claim about the origins of the virus.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump just announced that the \u2018biological\u2019 lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created was \u2018funded\u2019 by President Barak Hussein Obama in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars,\u201d the post reads. It further claims, falsely, that \u201cthis fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!\u201d\n\nThe post, a text image, was uploaded as early as April but is continuing to spread.\n\nFirst of all, the suggestion that the virus was \u201ccreated\u201d is a baseless conspiracy theory that we first wrote about in February. We\u2019ve continued to debunk similar claims.\n\nThe post\u2019s main claim about U.S. funding is one that we\u2019ve also previously addressed.\n\nThe $3.8 million figure refers actually to a $3.4 million grant that the National Institutes of Health awarded to a U.S.-based group, EcoHealth Alliance. That group was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats and first received the grant in 2014.\n\nOf that amount, EcoHealth gave $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology \u2014 a collaborator on the project that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department \u2014 Robert Kessler, EcoHealth\u2019s spokesperson, previously told us.\n\nThe grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, Kessler said \u2014 and EcoHealth received $292,161 that year (part of the total $3.4 million it received). NIH terminated the grant in April.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also previously floated an unsupported claim that the amount received by the Wuhan lab was even higher \u2014 $7.5 million \u2014 and that he \u201cended it.\u201d But as we explained before, the grant that was discontinued was EcoHealth\u2019s and the portion that went to the lab was $600,000.\n\nA Fox News story in April also made reference to another $3.4 million NIH grant \u2014 regarding a behavioral study \u2014 and suggested that some of the funding may have gone to the Wuhan lab. (The story noted, however, that it was \u201cnot clear exactly how much U.S. funding went directly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it worked in collaboration with other institutions on the projects funded by the American grants.\u201d)\n\nBut the recipient of that other grant, which was renewed this year \u2014 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York \u2014 told us that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201c[B]ased on CSHL\u2019s records for its NIH R01 award MH101214, there is nothing to indicate that any money from this grant was provided to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\u201d Dagnia Zeidlickis, the lab\u2019s vice president of communications, told us in an email.\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

That also is not accurate.\n\nAnd finally, Pence said that Trump\u2019s action gave the United States time to set up its response to the pandemic. But some disease experts say the Trump administration did not use that time effectively.\n\nPence, June 16: You know, before we had a single coronavirus case in this country, this president shut down all travel from China. It bought us invaluable time to stand up our national response.\n\nThere have been more than 2.1 million cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in the United States and more than 116,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, China, late last year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the China travel restrictions on Jan. 31. The restrictions, which went into effect Feb. 2, prohibited non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S.\n\nBut the new rules didn\u2019t apply to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members.\n\nA New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect. So travel from China had hardly been \u201cshut down.\u201d\n\nTrump, too, has frequently overstated the extent of his travel restrictions. For example, as we have written, in April he three times incorrectly referred to a \u201ctravel ban\u201d and on another occasion said he had \u201cclosed the border\u201d with China.\n\nPence also was off-base in saying the travel restrictions were imposed before the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the United States. In fact, the first reported case was confirmed 11 days earlier, on Jan. 20. The infected man, a resident of Snohomish County, Washington, in his 30s, developed symptoms after returning from a trip to the area around Wuhan.\n\nThere were four confirmed cases as of Jan. 31, when the travel restrictions were announced, and nine cases two days later, when they took effect, according to the CDC.\n\nTrump has said accurately that no one had died in the U.S. when his administration announced the travel restrictions. The first reported coronavirus death in this country was disclosed on Feb. 29.\n\nPence said the travel restrictions \u201cbought us invaluable time to stand up our national response.\u201d But experts have faulted Trump for failing to use that time to act more aggressively in dealing with the pandemic. In fact, between Jan. 22 and March 10, Trump frequently minimized the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nFor example, Trump said on Feb. 26, \u201cAnd again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nAnd as late as March 10, the president said, \u201cAnd we\u2019re prepared, and we\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\u201d The following day, the World Health Organization declared the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.\n\nAsked whether the restrictions had indeed \u201cbought us invaluable time,\u201d Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email: \u201cI do think it bought us a bit of time, though it was not very well or effectively implemented. The White House was in denial for January and most of February, and then took a laissez-faire attitude for much of March, squandering that time.\u201d\n\nOne of the keys to dealing with a pandemic is widespread testing. In an ad in May, the Trump campaign misleadingly boasted that the president had taken \u201cfast action\u201d in regard to testing. But several infectious disease experts also disputed that assertion.\n\n\u201cThe United States has lagged nearly every developed country in ramping up testing, and the slow action is one reason why we have the worst epidemic in the world and are discussing reopening when it is not safe to do so, while other countries have used testing as a centerpiece of their strategy to reduce cases to a point where reopening is much more appropriate,\u201d Lipsitch, told us for a previous story. \u201cThe lack of testing has been not only a public health catastrophe in the US, but also is a direct cause of our economic suffering.\u201d\n\nAnd Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in an email at the time: \u201cWe need only look at other countries (like South Korea, Germany, Singapore, New Zealand and others) to see what rapid testing and identification can do to slow down spread of this virus. South Korea had done 150,000 tests before we had done 500. The fact that we have more deaths per million in the population than many other developed countries is a testament to our slow response to this virus.\u201d\n\nAmong the factors slowing down the testing were the CDC\u2019s problems in producing tests and delays in enlisting hospital labs and commercial labs in developing tests, according to Tom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration. In April, we documented the extent and causes of the testing delays.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you.

The law lowered many individual tax rates, nearly doubled the standard deduction, eliminated personal exemptions and increased child tax credits, among other changes. It also cut the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It is expected to add $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years.\n\nIn an open letter to Congress in November 2017, more than 100 economists in support of the tax cuts predicted the tax cuts would \u201cignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations.\u201d\n\nA Congressional Research Service review of the first-year impact of the law, however, did not find evidence of \u201clarge effects particularly in the short run.\u201d\n\nCRS, May 22, 2019: In 2018, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 2.9%, about the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO\u2019s) projected rate published in 2017 before the tax cut. On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy. Although growth rates cannot indicate the tax cut\u2019s effects on GDP, they tend to rule out very large effects particularly in the short run. Although investment grew significantly, the growth patterns for different types of assets do not appear to be consistent with the direction and size of the supply-side incentive effects one would expect from the tax changes. This potential outcome may raise questions about how much longer-run growth will result from the tax revision.\n\nLast week, Biden seized on the GDP growth figures highlighted in the CRS report to argue that the TCJA has \u201cgenerated virtually no growth at all.\u201d And, Biden added, that is according to conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cImagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut and we hadn\u2019t wasted it on the wealthy, that generated virtually no growth at all,\u201d Biden said on \u201cThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah\u201d on June 10. \u201cNo growth at all, according to most of the conservative think tanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd imagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut that he promoted and got passed for the wealthy, even places like the Heritage Foundation said that didn\u2019t grow the economy. $2 trillion,\u201d Biden said on June 11 during a roundtable meeting in Philadelphia on opening the economy. \u201cImagine if we had it right now, to focus on the things that can build a new economy, invest in everything from teleconference, into providing for the kind of health.\u201d\n\nWhat Economists Say\n\nWe reached out to the Biden campaign for backup, and it passed along the nonpartisan CRS report, which as we said, concluded that \u201cthe growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign also pointed to a May 29, 2019, article from Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, who wrote that the CRS report findings were consistent with the Tax Policy Center prediction in December 2017 that the \u201cshort-term macroeconomic effects\u201d would be \u201cextremely modest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fairness, the tax cuts didn\u2019t occur in a vacuum,\u201d Gleckman wrote in that same article. \u201cSome of their benefits may have been offset by President Trump\u2019s own highly restrictive trade policy, or magnified by new deficit spending approved by Congress in 2018.\u201d\n\nIn his latest update about the economic impact of the TCJA, published on Feb. 5, Gleckman concluded after looking at two years of data: \u201cDespite the Trump Administration\u2019s rosy promises that the post-TCJA economy would boom, it has instead grown on many dimensions at roughly the same steady, unspectacular pace as it did prior to passage of the tax law.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur forecast at the time the TCJA became law was for a modest short-term bump in economic output (mostly from people spending their tax cuts) followed by a gradual return to pre-TCJA trend,\u201d Gleckman told us via email. \u201cThat is pretty much what happened. \u2026 Business investment fell after passage. Employment pretty much tracked pre-TCJA trends. GDP growth had its bump, then returned to trend.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember too that the growth story the White House told was this: The TCJA would encourage more capital investment that would lead to more productivity and, eventually, to higher wages,\u201d Gleckman said. \u201cThe reality was: We never even got the first step, except for a brief period just before and after passage of the law.\u201d\n\nGleckman acknowledged, however, that it is \u201cimpossible to pull apart tax policy from other issues, including Trump\u2019s trade policy in 2018 and 2019.\u201d It is possible, he said, that the \u201cTCJA contributed to more growth but that benefit was offset by the tariffs (which are a tax increase on US consumers and businesses). Or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disruptions of 2020 mean we never will know the long-term effects of the TCJA,\u201d Gleckman said. \u201cBut based on what we saw in 2018 and 2019, there is no evidence that the TCJA contributed very much to economic growth.\u201d\n\nThose analyses \u2014 from CRS and the Tax Policy Center, which is not a conservative group \u2014 provide some ammunition for Biden\u2019s claim that the TCJA \u201cgenerated virtually no growth at all.\u201d That\u2019s his assessment, and some economists agree.\n\nBut Biden is wrong to claim that \u201cmost of the conservative think tanks\u201d agree.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign cited three articles that it says came from conservative institutions: two from the American Enterprise Institute and one from the Tax Foundation. None of them support Biden\u2019s claim, though.\n\nThe article from Nicole Kaeding, then at the Tax Foundation, was titled \u201cThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act After A Year\u201d and was published on Dec. 17, 2018.\n\nKaeding wrote that one year after the law\u2019s passage there was \u201cvery little\u201d evidence \u201cwe point to on how the Act has impacted the U.S economy.\u201d But Kaeding also wrote that \u201cthe law\u2019s design is such that the economic impacts are long-run. It takes several years for the lower cost of capital to impact investment. Firms need time to plan, purchase, and permit new investments before they put the items into service. As we noted in our original score, much of the acceleration of growth happens several years after the law\u2019s original passage, before fading as provisions in the law expire.\u201d\n\nGarrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said Biden is distorting the Tax Foundation\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cOur position is not that the TCJA \u2018has generated no growth at all,\u2019 but rather that identifying the specific impact the TCJA had on growth is challenging given the many other factors at play that drive business investment and economic growth,\u201d Watson told us via email. \u201cThis includes the economic headwinds produced by the escalating trade war in 2019 and the coronavirus pandemic today. This is in addition to the fact that it may take several years to isolate the impact of a tax change, as Nicole pointed out in her piece. We provided feedback on a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report on TCJA last year, for example, arguing that \u2018its conclusion that the TCJA has produced little to no increase in output (GDP) and its argument that investment has not increased as was expected\u2026are too strong given the evidence.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe first article from the American Enterprise Institute cited by the Biden campaign was one written by Alan Viard, a resident scholar at AEI. Although Viard wrote that \u201ca sharp uptick in investment has not occurred,\u201d he did not conclude that the TCJA has generated no growth.\n\nRather, Viard posed three possibilities, only one of which considers the possibility that \u201cthe corporate tax cut is not boosting investment.\u201d It is also possible, he wrote, that \u201cthe boost is taking longer than expected\u201d or that \u201cthe tax cut boosted investment relative to what it would otherwise have been, even as other factors (perhaps other TCJA provisions or the trade war) have offset the boost.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be very surprising it if didn\u2019t generate any growth at all,\u201d Viard told us in a phone interview, adding that as a general economic principle, the corporate tax cuts should increase investment in the U.S.\n\nViard said that while \u201cthe growth impact may be smaller than many of us [conservative economists] thought,\u201d it is \u201cimpossible to know\u201d whether the law\u2019s effects are simply taking longer than expected, or if the growth it generated has been offset by other factors, such as the trade war.\n\nThe third article cited by the Biden campaign is a blog post written for AEI by Jason Furman. But Furman is not affiliated with AEI. Furman, an economics professor at Harvard and a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, served eight years as a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. According to Viard, Furman was simply invited to participate in a blog symposium about the effects of the TCJA. The symposium sought to include input from economists across the ideological spectrum.\n\nWrong on Heritage Foundation\n\nAs for Biden\u2019s specific claim that \u201ceven places like the Heritage Foundation said that [TCJA] didn\u2019t grow the economy,\u201d the Biden campaign did not get back to us with backup for that.\n\nBut the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, says that\u2019s false.\n\nOn Twitter, Adam Michel, a senior policy analyst who focuses on tax policy for the Heritage Foundation, pointed to his Dec. 12 commentary \u201cHow 2 Years of Tax Cuts Have Supported Our Strong Economy.\u201d\n\nWhen Biden said something similar last August, Michel tweeted, \u201cI think I\u2019ve written something basically every week for the last year+ that says the tax cuts are working.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets, Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of Heritage, also took issue with Biden\u2019s comments, saying, \u201cThe country saw increased wage growth, business investment, and employment thanks to the law.\u201d\n\nIn a Nov. 4 post, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation looked at what economists from various viewpoints were saying about the TCJA nearly two years after its implementation. One of its conclusions: \u201cEconomists do not agree on the economic effects of the TCJA.\u201d Additionally, it concludes, \u201ceconomists generally agree that while certain definitive trends are emerging, it is impossible to undertake a full accounting of the TCJA\u2019s effects until more time has passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cA full analysis of the effects of the TCJA will not be possible to complete for years to come, if ever,\u201d the Peterson report states.\n\nBiden is, of course, entitled to his opinion about the effect of the TCJA. And he has numerous economists he could cite who agree the tax cuts have, to date, resulted in very little economic growth. But he is wrong when he says that \u201cmost of the conservative think tanks\u201d in general, and the Heritage Foundation in particular, agree that the tax cuts resulted in \u201cvirtually no growth.\u201d In fact, they do not agree.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

The meme distorts the details of Floyd\u2019s case and includes a photo of a woman who was badly injured in an unrelated attack in Spain in 2018.\n\nFull Story\n\nA popular meme has misrepresented a criminal case involving George Floyd more than a decade ago.\n\nFloyd\u2019s death in police custody on May 25 sparked nationwide protests against racism and police violence, which has made the incident a target for misinformation since then.\n\nNow a meme with a photo of a woman\u2019s bruised and bloody face is circulating on social media with this claim: \u201cAracely Henriquez was the woman kidnapped and brutally beaten by George #Floyd and his five accomplices, as they searched her home for drugs and money. She was pregnant at the time, and he asked her if she wanted him to kill her baby.\u201d\n\nBut the woman pictured is not Aracely Henriquez. The photo actually shows Andrea Sicignano, an American student who was raped and beaten in Madrid, Spain, in 2018.\n\nIn a June 12 post on Facebook, Sicignano wrote, \u201cToday my photo is being used as political propaganda/click bait to make people believe that George Floyd deserved to die.\u201d She asked that those who see her photo being used that way report it to Facebook and correct the person who shared it.\n\nThe photo, Sicignano explained in her recent post, was taken at the hospital after she was attacked. She posted it on Facebook shortly after the attack, and the picture was later published in a Spanish newspaper, which is likely where it was taken from for the meme.\n\nBeyond the use of the picture, the meme gets other parts of the claim wrong, too.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s true about the case:\n\nFloyd pleaded guilty in 2009 to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. He was not charged with kidnapping or assault.\n\nAccording to the complaint in the case, filed in 2007, Floyd was one of six men who forced his way into the Houston home that Aracely Henriquez shared with Angel Negrete and a 1-year-old child.\n\nOne of the men claimed to be from the water department in order to get Henriquez to open the door. Then Floyd, who was described as the biggest of the men who pulled up in a black Ford Explorer, forced his way in and \u201cplaced a pistol against the complainant\u2019s abdomen, and forced her into the living room,\u201d the complaint says. It doesn\u2019t say whether or not Henriquez was pregnant.\n\nFloyd then searched the house while another man guarded Henriquez. That man hit her in the \u201chead and side areas\u201d with his pistol after she \u201cscreamed for help,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nSo, while Floyd did plead guilty to a charge stemming from the invasion of Henriquez\u2019s home, the picture circulating with the claim doesn\u2019t show Henriquez and the claim distorts the details of the case.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Some of the officers and officials in the videos can clearly be seen wearing masks.\n\nFull Story\n\nSince the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, conspiracy theories about his death have swirled online as posts have falsely suggested that the death was \u201cstaged\u201d or that \u201ccrisis actors\u201d were involved.\n\nNow, a repeatedly posted image on Facebook feeding into that narrative wrongly claims that the killing was \u201cfilmed before covid19\u201d because \u201cnot a single person is wearing a mask\u201d in the videos.\n\n\u201cIt just dawned on me the most glaring component of the Floyd psyop\u2026 it was filmed before covid19\u2026 How do I know\u2026 Not a single person is wearing a mask\u2026\u201d the post claims. It specifically asserts that Floyd and \u201cthe cops,\u201d among others, were not wearing masks.\n\nBut the claim is undercut by a review of footage that is publicly available.\n\nTake the viral video that shows former Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, for example. The video, captured by a bystander, shows that two EMTs who arrived at the scene, and who helped put Floyd into an ambulance, can be seen wearing surgical masks.\n\nChauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter and second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony.\n\nOther footage captured by surveillance cameras at a nearby restaurant also shows that former Officer Thomas Lane \u2014 one of three officers charged with aiding and abetting unintentional second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter \u2014 was also wearing a mask.\n\nAnother officer who was present at the scene can also be seen wearing a face covering, the surveillance video shows. More footage captures a firefighter, who arrived after the ambulance left, also wearing a mask.\n\nSo the assertion that \u201c[n]ot a single person is wearing a mask\u201d in the videos is false. The footage, in fact, undercuts the baseless theory that Floyd\u2019s death was \u201cfilmed before covid19.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Testing accounts for some of the rise, but doesn\u2019t explain all of it.\n\nOklahoma, the site of Trump\u2019s rally, has seen an increase in the number of people who are \u201ccurrently hospitalized\u201d with confirmed cases of COVID-19, state data shows. But GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma falsely said of his state: \u201cWe continue to see hospitalizations decline.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Pence wrongly said that COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma have \u201cdeclined precipitously.\u201d The state Health Department reports that \u201cOklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases,\u201d reaching a new single-day high on June 16.\n\nTrump is set to speak at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 20.\n\nTrump\u2019s Testing Tweet\n\nIn a June 15 tweet, Trump once again bragged about America\u2019s ability to test for the coronavirus, leaving the misleading impression that better testing is responsible for the country\u2019s large number of cases.\n\n\u201cOur testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Trump repeated the sentiment, saying in a roundtable at the White House, \u201cIf you don\u2019t test, you don\u2019t have any cases. If we stopped testing right now, we\u2019d have very few cases, if any.\u201d\n\nTo some extent he\u2019s right \u2014 if there were less testing, then the reported number of cases would be lower, although of course those infections would still exist.\n\nBut experts say Trump is wrong to claim that the U.S. is more advanced on testing \u201cthan any other country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe US may have done the most tests, but not the highest # of tests per capita. And our positivity is higher than many other countries,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said on Twitter in response to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cIn summary: we still haven\u2019t done enough testing for the size of our epidemic, which is largest in world,\u201d she added.\n\nAs we have explained before, the total number of tests completed is not necessarily reflective of how well a country is meeting the challenge of diagnosing its COVID-19 patients. Typically, a superior indicator is tests per capita, which takes into account a country\u2019s population. And even better is the test positivity rate, or the proportion of tests that are positive, which can show how much testing has been done relative to the size of an outbreak.\n\nAs of June 14 \u2014 the latest data available when Trump made his claim \u2014 the U.S. had completed just over 23.5 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nThat is the largest number of total tests performed by a single country, per statistics collected by Our World in Data. But it is not the top per-capita rate. On that metric, 16 other nations best the U.S., including Iceland, Denmark, Russia, Italy and Australia.\n\nAnd with nearly 9% of all tests having come back positive, the U.S. is not even close to being in the vanguard for low test positivity: The U.S. ranks behind at least 50 other nations.\n\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned before, there are limitations with the figures compiled by Our World in Data, since different countries report their testing statistics differently. So the numbers may not be directly comparable, but they are widely viewed as the best available international data on the subject.\n\nA Johns Hopkins website that uses slightly different calculations based on daily averages \u2014 which Nuzzo told us was done because different countries are in different stages of their pandemics \u2014 also shows the U.S. lagging behind numerous other countries on per-capita tests, test positivity or both.\n\nThe website notes that countries\u2019 testing programs \u201cshould be scaled to the size of their epidemic, not the size of the population\u201d and says the positivity rate \u201cis the most reliable way to determine if a government is testing enough.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization suggested on May 12 that nations achieve a 5% or lower test positivity rate for at least two weeks before considering loosening public health measures.\n\nThe cumulative test positivity rate in the U.S. has yet to go that low, although the U.S. is close to reaching that two-week benchmark, as data from the COVID Tracking Project demonstrates.\n\nThe national number, however, still obscures vast differences in locations across the country. A Johns Hopkins data visualization shows that as of June 16, 34 states plus Washington, D.C., have had 5% or fewer tests come back positive, as averaged over the past seven days, while 16 states and Puerto Rico are still above that level.\n\nKudlow\u2019s False Hospitalization Claim\n\nIn an interview on CNN about COVID-19, Kudlow inaccurately attributed rising hospitalization numbers in some parts of the country to elective procedures. Those figures are specific to people diagnosed with COVID-19, and therefore are unaffected by elective procedures.\n\nKudlow also suggested that increased testing was responsible for the uptick in cases. But more testing only partially explains the trends.\n\nKudlow made his remarks in a June 14 interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d with Jake Tapper.\n\nHe first acknowledged that some places in the U.S. have recently seen a rise in the number of COVID-19 infections.\n\n\u201cWe have had an increase in cases in some states. I don\u2019t want to hide that. That\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina and Florida. There have been some small metropolitan areas that have had an increase.\u201d\n\nBut then he pointed out that testing has increased, and said that hospitalizations were up because of elective procedures now being allowed.\n\n\u201cNow, remember, Jake, we are now testing at about a hundred times the rate we were back in March, when the pandemic first exploded,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201c[H]ospitalizations may be going up,\u201d he added, \u201cbut that\u2019s because elective procedures are now permitted. And maybe, most importantly, Jake, although the case rate has increased a bit, we\u2019re not talking about a second round here.\u201d\n\nBut hospitalizations are not up in some areas because of elective procedures. \u201cStates should be tracking COVID-related hospitalizations,\u201d said Johns Hopkins\u2019 Nuzzo in an email to FactCheck.org, \u201cnot all hospitalizations.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, they are, although not all states report hospitalizations or document them over time. Texas posted a record-high of 2,287 \u201cCOVID-19 hospitalizations\u201d on the day Kudlow made his remarks \u2014 a tally that has since climbed to 2,518, according to the state dashboard.\n\nThe number is the sum of all \u201clab-confirmed\u201d COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the state\u2019s trauma service areas, which has risen nearly 40% since Memorial Day.\n\nState data in Arkansas also shows a surge since the end of May, with 214 \u201ccurrently hospitalized COVID-19 patients\u201d as of June 16 \u2014 approximately double the number two weeks ago.\n\nNorth Carolina, too, has seen a steady rise in the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations for the past month. The state notes that the figures reflect the \u201ccurrent hospitalizations due to COVID-19,\u201d which are self-reported by hospitals.\n\nThere is another hospital metric \u2014 bed use rates, or hospital capacity \u2014 that could change as hospitals reopen and begin to do more surgeries. As Nuzzo said, \u201cBed availability is another element to track and that would be influenced by the resumption of elective procedures.\u201d\n\nBut even if that is what Kudlow meant \u2014 and we asked the White House for clarification, but didn\u2019t hear back \u2014 it isn\u2019t what he said.\n\nUpticks in COVID-19 Cases Not Just Due to More Testing\n\nKudlow\u2019s more fundamental claim, which Trump echoed and Pence also suggested, is that the increases some states are now seeing in their COVID-19 cases are because of expanded testing.\n\nThe New York Times reported on June 15 that Pence told governors in a private call to \u201cmake sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,\u201d and that in \u201cmost of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number, that\u2019s more a result of the extraordinary work you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nIn the call, Pence also repeated Kudlow\u2019s false claim that \u201cbecause people are going back to hospitals and elective surgery and getting ordinary care, hospitalization rates may be going up.\u201d\n\nAt a roundtable the same day, the vice president said, \u201cWe really believe that the vast majority of new cases is a reflection, as you said, of a dramatic increase in testing.\u201d\n\nHe then gave the example of California, which he said had flat hospitalization and test positivity numbers. \u201cAnd in those areas where \u2014 just a few states \u2014 where we\u2019re seeing positive rates go up, we\u2019ll be talking to governors today, in states like Georgia and Arizona and Texas, about deploying additional CDC personnel to help them identify where those outbreaks are occurring and how we can mitigate those efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith more than 22 million tests having been performed across the country, we \u2014 we continue to see overall that what\u2019s called a positive test rate remains very stable in the country,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs we said earlier, Mr. President, there is a few states where the positivity rate is climbing, and we\u2019re working very closely with those governors to identify that.\u201d\n\nPence is right that at least for now, the nation\u2019s test positivity rate hasn\u2019t gone up, and that California\u2019s increased COVID-19 caseload is likely explained by bolstered testing.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true everywhere \u2014 and it\u2019s not just a \u201cfew\u201d states that have reported growth in their test positivity rates.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the number of cases reflects not just how many cases there are in the community, but also testing capacity,\u201d Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us during a press call. But, she added, \u201cI think that the signals that we\u2019re seeing from across the country are real, and they correspond to what we knew would happen when society started to open up, which is that we get more mixing, and we\u2019ll start to see the emergence of the virus spreading again.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Wall Street Journal in a June 16 interview that while more testing leads to more cases, higher positivity rates in many states \u201ccannot be explained by increased testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTesting positivity is going UP in nearly half of US states, which is a sign that increasing case numbers is not just due to more testing,\u201d noted Nuzzo in a tweet.\n\nTest positivity is an important metric because it should stay steady or decrease if increased testing is behind a higher number of identified cases. An increasing percentage of positive tests, as long as testing hasn\u2019t dropped off, indicates a surge in infections.\n\nAccording to a Johns Hopkins data visualization that tracks the weekly change in states\u2019 test positivity numbers, many of the states with increases in the percentage of positive tests are located in the South.\n\nCaitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, noted that testing could explain some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the upticks.\n\n\u201cAre increased case counts partially attributable to increased testing?\u201d she asked in a tweet. \u201cProbably in part. But in places where hospitalizations and the % of tests that come back positive is high or rising, those are sure signs of trouble.\u201d\n\nIn a June 11 call with reporters, Dr. Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, also emphasized looking at the hospitalization figures to understand what is happening \u2014 a point he later iterated in a Twitter thread.\n\n\u201cIn Texas, if you look at the numbers in detail, you can see that hospitalization rate is going up. Similarly, in Arizona, ICU beds, hospitalization rates for COVID patients are going up. So those are real changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more sick people than there were a month ago, substantially more.\u201d\n\nHe said California, though, did not have the same concerning trends. \u201cIn California, even though the number of daily cases is higher on a day-to-day basis than it was weeks ago, the overall hospitalization rate on their dashboard is stable,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that would suggest perhaps there\u2019s more testing going on in California and maybe they\u2019re finding more mild and moderate cases, but they aren\u2019t seeing a rise in the number of very sick people.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther states like Florida aren\u2019t reporting hospitalization,\u201d he added. \u201cSo you can\u2019t really make any determinations without having access to that data.\u201d\n\nMany public health experts suspect that reopening policies are behind the rise in some states, although Inglesby noted that not all states have experienced increases.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, some states that have reopened have not had sharp rises. I think as reopening goes forward, we\u2019ll be able to know more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we do know is that this virus transmits person to person, the more activity that\u2019s allowed that is based on close personal interaction, the more opportunities there will be for transmission.\u201d\n\nBuckee said it was too early to know what will happen for certain, but that the rising number of cases in some places will likely lead to more severe illnesses and deaths, even if it hasn\u2019t shown up yet.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s no question that we\u2019re going to see a surge in hospitalizations and deaths in places like Arizona, due to that uptick in cases,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of waiting for a few weeks.\u201d\n\nCases that happen now, she said, will result in deaths in about three weeks.\n\nIn addition to the increase in cases, she said many of the states in the southeastern U.S. have worrying demographic factors as well, which put those populations at higher risk.\n\n\u201cThe concern is not just the policies and the reopening and spreading of the virus, but the significant risks of morbidity and mortality in those populations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that African American communities are being hit particularly hard, diabetes is a risk factor, and so on. Those are all going to mean that we expect more illness and more death from COVID.\u201d\n\nOklahoma\u2019s \u2018COVID-19 Current Hospitalizations,\u2019 Cases Increase\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Sen. Lankford of Oklahoma was asked whether the president should postpone his Tulsa rally due to health concerns.\n\n\u201cI do not believe so, actually,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through phase one, phase two, and phase three. We continue to see hospitalizations decline, deaths decline in Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nThe senator is right about COVID-19 deaths, but not about hospitalizations.\n\nIn its most recent Weekly Epidemiology and Surveillance Report for the week of June 5 through June 11, the Oklahoma Department of Health said there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.\n\nOklahoma Department of Health, June 12: Oklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, though the number of deaths have remained approximately the same and the percentage of positives remains low at 3.7%. The increase in the number of cases is caused by both ongoing community transmission and outbreaks that affect specific populations. The threat of COVID still exists and we anticipate it to grow.\n\nFor the two-week reporting period, from June 1 to June 12, the number of \u201cCOVID-19 Cases Currently Hospitalized\u201d increased from 69 to 86, according to separate Executive Order Reports that the state Health Department publishes every weekday.\n\nAs of June 15, there were 98 current hospitalizations \u2014 the highest since May 7, when there were 113 people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, which tracks hospitalization data for 42 states, including Oklahoma.\n\nPrior to Lankford\u2019s appearance on \u201cThis Week,\u201d the Executive Order Reports showed a one-day drop on June 11, from 97 to 86. But, until the June 11 drop, there were six straight days of more COVID-19 hospitalizations, the reports show.\n\nThe most recent weekly epidemiology report also said there were 719 confirmed cases for the week ending June 11, an increase of 12.9% from the previous week, while deaths had declined 11.6%.\n\nDespite the current uptick in COVID-19 hospitalizations, there are still far fewer than there were in mid-April, according to the Carlson School of Management\u2019s hospitalization tracking website. The Sooner State recorded the highest number of hospitalizations on April 13, when 194 people were hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the university website.\n\n(Technical note: The state also issues \u201csituation update\u201d reports every weekday that provide \u201ccurrent hospitalizations,\u201d which the state Health Department says represent \u201ca combination of hospitalized positive cases and hospitalized persons under investigation.\u201d The Carlson School\u2019s website reports \u201conly the confirmed cases of hospitalizations\u201d when a state provides the data, as Oklahoma does, according to Pinar Karaca-Mandic, a professor of health care risk management and a project team leader. We, too, are using only confirmed cases for this story.)\n\nOklahoma has been slowly reopening its businesses since April 24, when it entered what Gov. Kevin Stitt called phase 1 of a three-phase plan. The state fully opened for business on June 1.\n\n\u201cUnder Phase 3, businesses may resume unrestricted staffing at their worksites by observing proper CDC-recommended social distancing protocols and are recommended to continue increased cleaning and disinfecting practices,\u201d according to a press release issued by the governor\u2019s office. \u201cIndividuals should minimize time spent in crowded environments and continue following CDC guidelines regarding social distancing.\u201d\n\nDespite the state\u2019s advice to \u201cminimize time spent in crowded environments,\u201d Trump said he expects to fill the BOK Center, which seats about 19,000, and is looking for a second location to increase capacity for the event.\n\n\u201cWe have a 22,000-seat arena, but I think we\u2019re going to also take the convention hall next door, and that\u2019s going to hold 40,000,\u201d Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on June 15. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have 22,000 plus 40,000. \u2026 [I]t\u2019s an amazing \u2014 nobody has ever heard numbers like this. I think we\u2019re going to have a \u2014 we\u2019re going to have a great time.\u201d\n\nAt the same Cabinet meeting, Pence expressed confidence about Oklahoma\u2019s ability to host the rally, in part because COVID-19 cases in the state have \u201cdeclined precipitously.\u201d\n\nPence, June 15: The number of cases in Oklahoma \u2014 it\u2019s declined precipitously, and we feel very confident going forward with the rally this coming weekend.\n\nThat\u2019s false. As we stated earlier, the state reports that the number of COVID-19 cases is now on the rise in Oklahoma.\n\nIn its weekly epidemiology report for May 29 through June 4, the state Health Department said there had been \u201c637 confirmed cases in the past week 8.0% increase from the week before (May 22-28).\u201d A week later, the department said that from June 5 to June 11 there had been \u201c719 confirmed cases in the past week 12.9% increase from the week before (May 29-June 4).\u201d\n\nA day after Pence\u2019s remarks, the state recorded a single-day high of 228 new cases on June 16, as well as four deaths.\n\nAs of June 11, at the time of the last weekly report, the state had 7,626 confirmed cases. As of June 16, Oklahoma had 8,645 confirmed cases \u2014 an increase of 1,019 cases, the daily state data shows.\n\nUpdate, June 18: The article was updated to include comments about testing from NIAID Director Anthony Fauci.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
